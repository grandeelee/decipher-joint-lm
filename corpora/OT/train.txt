chapter 46.
the lord says, “bel has fallen to the ground.
nebo is kneeling before me.
“men put those idols on the backs of animals.
they are only heavy burdens that must be carried.
they do nothing but make people tired.
but they all bowed down and fell to the ground.
they couldn’t escape; they were all carried away like prisoners.
“family of jacob, listen to me!
you who are left from the family of israel, listen!
i have carried you since you left your mother’s womb.
i carried you when you were born, 
and i will still be carrying you when you are old.
your hair will turn gray, and i will still carry you.
i made you, and i will carry you to safety.
“can you compare me to anyone?
no one is equal to me.
you cannot understand everything about me.
there is nothing like me.
some people are rich with gold and silver.
gold falls from their purses, and they weigh their silver on scales.
they pay an artist to make a false god from wood.
then they bow down and worship that false god.
they put their false god on their shoulders and carry it.
that false god is useless; people have to carry it!
people set the statue on the ground, and it cannot move.
that false god never walks away from its place.
people can yell at it, but it will not answer.
that false god is only a statue; it cannot save people from their troubles.
“sinners, change your heart and mind.
think about this again.
remember it and be strong.
remember what happened long ago.
remember, i am god and there is no other god.
there is no other like me.
“in the beginning, i told you what would happen in the end.
a long time ago, i told you things that have not happened yet.
when i plan something, it happens.
i do whatever i want to do.
i am calling a man from the east to do what i want.
he will come like an eagle from a faraway country.
he will do all that i have planned.
everything i said will happen just as i said it would.
“listen to me, you stubborn people!
you are far from doing what is right.
but i am close to making things right.
salvation will not be delayed much longer.
i will bring salvation to zion and to my wonderful israel.” 
psalm.
chapter 119.
great blessings belong to those who live pure lives!

they follow his ways.

people full of pride are always making fun of me, but i have not stopped following your teachings.
i remember the laws you gave us long ago, lord, and they bring me comfort.
i am overcome with anger when i see wicked people, who have stopped following your teachings.
your laws are the songs i sing wherever i am living.
lord, in the night i remembered your name, and i obeyed your teachings.
this happened because i carefully obey your instructions.
lord, i decided that my duty is to obey your commandments.
i beg you with all my heart, be kind to me, as you promised.
i thought very carefully about my life, and i decided to follow your rules.
without wasting any time, i hurried back to obey your commands.
the wicked tried to trap me, but i have not forgotten your teachings.
in the middle of the night, i get up to thank you because your laws are so fair.
i am a friend to everyone who worships you.

give me the knowledge to make wise decisions.
i trust your commands.
before i suffered, i did many wrong things.
but now i carefully obey everything you say.
you are good, and you do good things.
teach me your laws.
people full of pride made up lies about me.
but i keep obeying your instructions with all my heart.
those people are so stupid that they care for nothing, but i enjoy studying your teachings.
suffering was good for me; i learned your laws.
your teachings are worth more to me than a thousand pieces of silver and gold.
with your hands you made me and helped me become what i am.
now help me learn and understand your commands.
your followers will see me and be happy, because i trust in your word.

i enjoy your teachings.
bring shame on those proud people who lied about me.
all i want to do is study your instructions.

hide me and protect me.
i trust what you say.
don’t come near me, you who are evil, so that i can obey my god’s commands.
support me, lord, as you promised, and i will live.
i trust in you, so don’t disappoint me.
help me and i will be saved.
and i will always give attention to your laws.
you reject all who don’t obey your laws, because they are liars and did not do what they said.
you throw away the wicked of this world like trash.
so i love your rules.
i am shaking with fear before you.
i fear and respect your judgments.
i have done what is right and good.
don’t let me fall into the hands of those who want to hurt me.
promise to be good to me, your servant.

i carefully obey all your commands.
so i hate anything that leads people the wrong way.
lord, your rules are wonderful.
that is why i follow them.
as people understand your word, it brings light to their lives.
your word makes even simple people wise.

i have cried a river of tears because people don’t obey your teachings.
lord, you do what is right, and your decisions are fair.
the rules you have given us are right.
we can trust them completely.
something that really upsets me is the thought that my enemies ignore your commands.
i love your word.
time and again it has been proven true.
i am young, and people don’t respect me.
but i have not forgotten your instructions.
your goodness is forever, and your teachings can be trusted.
even though i have troubles and hard times, your commands give me joy.
your rules are always right.
help me understand them so that i can live.
lord, i call to you with all my heart.
answer me, and i will obey your laws.
i call to you.
save me, and i will obey your rules.
i get up early in the morning to pray to you.
i trust what you say.
late into the night i stay awake to think about your word.
i know your love is true, so listen to me.
lord, you always do what is right, so let me live.
here come those who have evil plans to hurt me.
they live far away from your teachings.
but you are near me, lord, and all your commands can be trusted.
long ago, i learned from your rules that you made them to last forever.
look at my suffering and rescue me.
i have not forgotten your teachings.
argue my case, and set me free.
let me live, as you promised.
the wicked have no hope of being saved, because they don’t follow your laws.
lord, you are very kind.
you always do what is right, so let me live.
i have many enemies trying to hurt me, but i have not stopped following your rules.
i look at those traitors and hate what i see, because they refuse to do what you say.
see how much i love your instructions!
lord, i know your love is true, so let me live.

i have wandered away like a lost sheep.

chapter 9.
this is the lord’s message against the land of hadrach and against the city of damascus.
the tribes of israel are not the only people who know about the lord.
everyone looks to him for help.
this message is also against the city of hamath near damascus.
and this message is against tyre and sidon, even though those people have been so wise and skillful.
tyre is built like a fort.
the people there have collected so much silver that it is like dust, and gold is as common as clay.
but the lord will take it all.
he will destroy her powerful navy and that city will be destroyed by fire!
the people in ashkelon will see this and they will be afraid.
the people of gaza will shake with fear, and the people of ekron will lose all hope when they see this happen.
there will be no king left in gaza.
no one will live in ashkelon anymore.
the people in ashdod will not even know who their real fathers are.
the lord says, “i will completely destroy the proud philistines.
they will no longer eat meat with the blood still in it or any other forbidden food.
any philistine left alive will become a part of my people; they will be just one more tribe in judah.
the people of ekron will become a part of my people, as the jebusites did.
i will protect my country.
i will not let enemy armies pass through it.
i will not let them hurt my people anymore.
with my own eyes i have seen how much my people have suffered.” 
people of zion, rejoice!
people of jerusalem, shout with joy!
look, your king is coming to you!
he is the good king who won the victory, but he is humble.
he is riding on a donkey, on a young donkey born from a work animal.
i will take the war chariots away from ephraim and the horse soldiers from jerusalem.
i will destroy the bows used in war.
your king will bring news of peace to the nations.
he will rule from sea to sea, from the euphrates river to the ends of the earth.
jerusalem, we used blood to seal your agreement, so i am setting your people free from that empty hole in the ground.
prisoners, go home!
now you have something to hope for.
i am telling you now, i am coming back to you.
judah, i will use you like a bow.
ephraim, i will use you like arrows.
israel, i will use you like a sword to fight against the men of greece.
the lord will appear to them, and he will shoot his arrows like lightning.
the lord god will blow the trumpet, and the army will rush forward like a desert dust storm.
the lord all-powerful will protect them.
the soldiers will use rocks and slings to defeat the enemy.
they will spill the blood of their enemies.
it will flow like wine.
it will be like the blood that is thrown on the corners of the altar!
at that time the lord their god will save his people like a shepherd saves his sheep.
they will be very precious to him.
they will be like sparkling jewels in his land.
everything will be good and beautiful!
there will be a wonderful crop, but it will not be just the food and wine.
it will be all the young men and women!
chapter 24.
“a man might marry a woman, and then find some secret thing about her that he does not like.
if that man is not pleased with her, he must write the divorce papers and give them to her.
then he must send her from his house.
when she has left his house, she may go and become another man’s wife.
but suppose the new husband also does not like her and sends her away.
if that man divorces her, the first husband may not take her again to be his wife.
or if the new husband dies, her first husband may not take her again to be his wife.
she has become unclean to him.
if he married her again, he would be doing something the lord hates.
you must not sin like this in the land that the lord your god is giving you.
“when a man is newly married, he must not be sent into the army.
and he must not be given any other special work.
for one year he must be free to stay home and make his new wife happy.
“when you lend someone something, you must not take as security any part of the stones used to grind flour.
that would be the same as taking away their food.
“someone might kidnap another israelite—one of their own people.
and that kidnapper might sell that person as a slave.
if that happens, that kidnapper must be killed.
you must remove this evil from your group.
“when you have a very bad skin disease, be very careful to follow everything the levite priests teach you.
you must follow carefully what i told the priests to do.
remember what the lord your god did to miriam on your trip out of egypt.
“when you give someone any kind of loan, you must not go into their house to get security.
you must stand outside.
then the person who you gave the loan to will bring out the security to you.
if he is a poor man, then he might give the clothes that keep him warm.
you must not keep that security overnight.
you must give his security back to him every evening.
then he will have clothes to sleep in.
he will bless you, and the lord your god will accept this as living right and doing good.
“you must not cheat a hired servant who is poor and needy.
it does not matter if he is an israelite or if he is a foreigner living in one of your cities.
give him his pay every day before sunset, because he is poor and depends on the money.
if you don’t pay him, he will complain against you to the lord, and you will be guilty of sin.
“parents must not be put to death for something their children did.
and children must not be put to death for something their parents did.
people should be put to death only for a bad thing that they themselves did.
“you must make sure that foreigners and orphans are treated fairly.
and you must never take clothes from a widow as security.
remember, you were poor slaves in egypt.
and the lord your god took you from that place and set you free.
that is why i tell you to do these things for the poor.
“you might be gathering your harvest in the field, and you might forget and leave some grain there.
you must not go back to get it.
it will be for the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows.
if you leave some grain for them, the lord your god will bless you in everything you do.
when you beat your olive trees, you must not go back to check the branches.
the olives you leave will be for the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows.
when you gather the grapes from your vineyard, you must not go back to gather the grapes you left.
they will be for the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows.
remember you were poor slaves in egypt.
that is why i tell you to do these things for the poor.
chapter 42.
“here is my servant, the one i support.
he is the one i have chosen, and i am very pleased with him.
i have filled him with my spirit, and he will bring justice to the nations.
he will not cry out or shout or try to make himself heard in the streets.
he will not break even a crushed reed.
he will not put out even the weakest flame.
he will bring true justice.
he will not grow weak or give up until he has brought justice to the world.
and people in faraway places will hope to receive his teachings.” 
the lord, the true god, said these things.
(he created the sky and spread it out over the earth.
he formed the earth and everything it produced.
he breathes life into all the people on earth.
he gives a spirit to everyone who walks on the earth.)
“i, the lord, was right to call you.
i will hold your hand and protect you.
you will be the sign of my agreement with the people.
you will be a light for the other nations.
you will make the blind able to see.
you will free those who are held as captives.
you will lead those who live in darkness out of their prison.
“i am yahweh.
that is my name.
i will not give my glory to another.
i will not let statues take the praise that should be mine.
in the past, i told you what would happen, and it happened!
now i am telling you something new, and i am telling you now, before it happens.” 
sing a new song to the lord; praise him everywhere on earth— all you who sail on the seas, everything in the sea, and all you people in faraway places!
deserts and cities, villages of kedar, praise the lord!
people living in sela, sing for joy!
sing from the top of your mountain.
give glory to the lord.
praise him, all you people in faraway lands!
the lord will go out like a strong soldier.
like a man going into battle, he will be full of excitement.
he will shout with a loud cry, and he will defeat his enemies.
“for a long time i have said nothing.
i have controlled myself and kept quiet.
but now i will cry out like a woman giving birth.
my breathing is getting faster and louder.
i will destroy the hills and mountains.
i will dry up all the plants that grow there.
i will change rivers to dry land and dry up pools of water.
then i will lead the blind along a path they never knew to places where they have never been before.
i will change darkness into light for them.
i will make the rough ground smooth.
i will do these things for them; i will not abandon my people.
but some of them have left me.
they say to their gold statues, ‘you are my gods.’ they trust their false gods, but they will be disappointed and shamed.
“deaf people, listen to me!
blind people, look and see!
in all the world, no one is more blind than my servant.
no one is more deaf than my messenger.
no one is more blind than my chosen people, the servant of the lord.
my people see what they should do, but they do not obey me.
they can hear with their ears, but they refuse to listen to me.” 
the lord wants them to do what is right.
he wants them to honor his wonderful teachings.
but look at his people.
others have defeated them and have stolen from them.
the young men are afraid.
they are locked in prisons.
people have taken advantage of them, and there is no one to protect them.
others take their money, and there is no one to say, “give it back!” 
will any of you pay attention to this warning?
will you ever learn to listen?
who let jacob be defeated?
who let others take what belonged to israel?
the lord allowed them to do this.
we sinned against him, so he let people take away our wealth.
the people did not want to live the way he wanted.
they refused to listen to his teaching.
so he poured out his anger on them and brought wars against them.
it was as if there were fires all around them, but they didn’t know what was happening.
it was as if they were burning, but they didn’t try to understand.
chapter 1.
zechariah son of berekiah received a message from the lord.
this was in the eighth month of the second year that darius was king in persia.
(zechariah was the son of berekiah, who was the son of iddo the prophet.)
this is that message: 
the lord became very angry with your ancestors.
so you must tell the people what the lord all-powerful says, “come back to me, says the lord all-powerful, and i will come back to you.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“don’t be like your ancestors.
in the past the prophets spoke to them and said, ‘the lord all-powerful wants you to change your evil way of living.
stop doing evil things!’ but your ancestors did not listen to me.” this is what the lord said.
“your ancestors are gone, and those prophets did not live forever.
the prophets were my servants.
i used them to tell your ancestors about my laws and teachings.
your ancestors finally learned their lesson and said, ‘the lord all-powerful did what he said he would do.
he punished us for the way we lived and for all the evil things we did.’ so they came back to god.” 
on the 24th day of the eleventh month (shebat) of the second year that darius was king of persia, zechariah received another message from the lord.
(this was zechariah son of berekiah, son of iddo.)
this is the message: 
at night i saw a man riding a red horse.
he was standing among some myrtle bushes in the valley.
behind him, there were red, brown, and white horses.
i said, “sir, what are these horses for?” then the angel speaking to me said, “i will show you what these horses are for.” 
then the man standing among the myrtle bushes said, “the lord sent these horses to go here and there on earth.” 
then the horses spoke to the lord’s angel standing among the myrtle bushes and said, “we have walked here and there on the earth, and everything is calm and quiet.” 
then the lord’s angel said, “lord all-powerful, how long before you comfort jerusalem and the cities of judah?
you have shown your anger at these cities for 70 years now.” 
then the lord answered the angel who was talking with me.
he spoke good, comforting words.
then the angel told me to tell the people this: the lord all-powerful says: “i have a strong love for jerusalem and zion.
and i am very angry at the nations that feel so safe.
i was only a little angry, and i used them to punish my people.
but they caused too much damage.” 
so the lord says, “i will come back to jerusalem and comfort her.” the lord all-powerful says, “jerusalem will be rebuilt, and my house will be built there.” 
the angel also said, “the lord all-powerful says, ‘my towns will be rich again.
i will comfort zion.
i will again choose jerusalem to be my special city.’” 
then i looked up and i saw four horns.
so i asked the angel who was talking with me, “what do these horns mean?” he said, “these are the horns that forced the people of israel, judah, and jerusalem to go to foreign countries.” 
the lord showed me four workers.
i asked him, “what are these four workers coming to do?” he said, “the horns represent the nations that attacked the people of judah and forced them to go to foreign countries.
the horns ‘threw’ the people of judah to the foreign countries.
the horns didn’t show mercy to anyone.
but these four workers have come to frighten the horns and throw them away.” 
amos.
chapter 7.
this is what the lord god showed me: he was making locusts.
this was at the time the second crop began to grow, after the king’s people had cut the first crop.
before the locusts could eat all the grass in the country, i said, “lord god, i beg you, forgive us!
jacob cannot survive!
he is too small!” 
then the lord changed his mind about this.
the lord said, “it will not happen.” 
this is what the lord god showed me: i saw the lord god calling for judgment by fire.
the fire destroyed the ocean and was beginning to eat up the land.
but i said, “lord god, stop, i beg you!
jacob cannot survive!
he is too small!” 
then the lord changed his mind about this.
the lord god said, “it will not happen either.” 
this is what the lord showed me: he stood by a wall with a plumb line in his hand.
(the wall had been marked with a plumb line.)
the lord said to me, “amos, what do you see?” i said, “a plumb line.” then the lord said to me, “see, i will put a plumb line among my people israel.
i will not let their ‘crooked ways’ pass inspection anymore.
isaac’s high places will be destroyed.
israel’s holy places will be made into a pile of rocks.
i will attack and kill jeroboam’s family with swords.” 
amaziah, a priest at bethel, sent this message to jeroboam, the king of israel: “amos is making plans against you.
he is trying to make the people of israel fight against you.
he has been speaking so much that this country cannot hold all his words.
amos has said, ‘jeroboam will die by the sword, and the people of israel will be taken as prisoners out of their country.’” 
amaziah also said to amos, “you seer, go down to judah and eat there.
do your prophesying there.
but don’t prophesy anymore here at bethel.
this is jeroboam’s holy place.
this is israel’s temple.” 
then amos answered amaziah, “i am not a professional prophet, and i am not from a prophet’s family.
i raise cattle and take care of sycamore trees.
i was a shepherd and the lord took me from following the sheep.
the lord said to me, ‘go, prophesy to my people israel.’ 
so listen to the lord’s message.
you tell me, ‘don’t prophesy against israel.
don’t speak against isaac’s family.’ 
but the lord says, ‘your wife will become a prostitute in the city.
your sons and daughters will be killed with swords.
other people will take your land and divide it among themselves, and you will die in a foreign country.
the people of israel will definitely be taken from this country as prisoners.’” 
amos.
chapter 3.
people of israel, listen to this message!
this is what the lord said about you, israel.
this message is about all the families that i brought from the land of egypt.
“there are many families on earth, but you are the only family i chose to know in a special way.
and you turned against me, so i will punish you for all your sins.” 
two people will not walk together unless they have agreed to do so.
a lion will roar in the forest only if it catches its prey.
a young lion roaring in his cave means he has caught something to eat.
a bird doesn’t fly into a trap unless there is food in it.
if a trap closes, it will catch the bird.
if people hear the warning blast of a trumpet, they shake with fear.
if trouble comes to a city, the lord caused it to happen.
when the lord god decides to do something, he will first tell his servants, the prophets.
when a lion roars, people are frightened.
when the lord god speaks, a prophet must prophesy.
go to the high towers in ashdod and in egypt and announce this message from the lord: “come together on the mountains of samaria.
see the great confusion there because the people don’t know how to live right.
see how cruel they are to others.
they take things from people to hide in their high towers.
their treasuries are filled with the things they have taken in war.” 
so the lord god says, “an enemy will surround your land.
they will break down your strong walls and take the things you have hidden in your high towers.” 
the lord says, “a lion might attack a lamb, and a shepherd might try to save the lamb.
but the shepherd will save only a part of that lamb.
he might pull two legs or a part of an ear from the lion’s mouth.
in the same way, most of the people of israel will not be saved.
those who live in samaria will save only a corner from a bed, or a piece of cloth from a couch.” 
this is what the lord god all-powerful says: “warn the family of jacob about these things.
israel sinned, and i will punish them for their sins.
and when i do, i will also destroy the altars at bethel.
the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
i will destroy the winter house with the summer house.
the houses of ivory will be destroyed.
many houses will be destroyed.” this is what the lord said.
chapter 36.
“so bezalel, oholiab, and all the other skilled men must do the work the lord has commanded.
the lord has given these men the wisdom and understanding to do all the skilled work needed to build this holy place.” 
then moses called bezalel, oholiab, and all the other skilled men who the lord had given special skills to.
and they came because they wanted to help with the work.
moses gave them everything the israelites had brought as gifts, and they used these things to build the holy place.
the people continued to bring gifts each morning.
finally, all the skilled workers left the work they were doing on the holy place, and they went to speak to moses.
they said, 
“the people have brought too much.
we have more than we need to finish the work the lord told us to do.” 
then moses sent this message throughout the camp: “no man or woman should make anything else as a gift for the holy place.” so the people were forced to stop giving more.
the people had brought more than enough things to finish the work of building god’s holy place.
then the skilled workers began making the holy tent.
they made the ten curtains from fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn.
and they sewed pictures of cherub angels with wings into the curtains.
each curtain was the same size—28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide.
the workers joined the curtains together into two groups of curtains.
they joined five curtains together to make one group and five curtains together to make the other group.
then they used blue cloth to make loops along the edge of the end curtain of one group.
and they did the same on the end curtain in the other group.
there were 50 loops on the end curtain in one group and 50 loops on the end curtain in the other group.
the loops were opposite each other.
then they made 50 gold rings to join the two curtains together.
so the holy tent was joined together into one piece.
then the workers made another tent to cover the holy tent.
they used goat hair to make eleven curtains.
all the curtains were the same size—30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide.
the workers joined five curtains together into one group and six curtains together into another group.
they put 50 loops along the edge of the end curtain of one group.
and they did the same on the end curtain of the other group.
the workers made 50 bronze rings to join the two groups of curtains together to form one tent.
then they made two more coverings for the holy tent.
one covering was made from ram skins dyed red.
the other covering was made from fine leather.
then the workers made frames from acacia wood to support the holy tent.
each frame was 10 cubits long and 1 1/2 cubits wide.
there were two side poles joined together with cross pieces to make each frame.
every frame for the holy tent was made the same.
they made 20 frames for the south side of the holy tent.
then they made 40 silver bases for the frames.
there were two bases for each frame—one base for each side pole.
they also made 20 frames for the other side (the north side) of the holy tent.
they made 40 silver bases for the frames—two bases for each frame.
they made six more frames for the back (the west side) of the holy tent.
they also made two frames for the corners at the back of the holy tent.
these frames were joined together at the bottom.
and at the top a ring held the corner frames together.
they did the same for both corners.
there were eight frames for the west side of the holy tent.
and there were 16 silver bases—two bases for each frame.
then the workers used acacia wood to make the braces for the frames—five braces for the first side of the holy tent, 
five braces for the other side, and five braces for the back of the holy tent (that is, the west side).
they made the middle brace so that it passed through the frames from one end to the other.
they covered these frames with gold.
then they used gold to make the rings to hold the braces, and they covered the braces with gold.
they used fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn to make the special curtain for the entrance to the most holy place.
and they sewed pictures of cherub angels into the curtain.
they made four posts using acacia wood, and they covered the posts with gold.
then they made gold hooks for the posts and four silver bases for the posts.
then they made the curtain to cover the entrance to the tent.
they used blue, purple, and red yarn and fine linen to make this curtain.
and they wove pictures into it.
then they made the five posts and the hooks for this curtain over the entrance.
they covered the tops of the posts and the curtain rods with gold.
and they made the five bronze bases for the posts.
chapter 7.
after we finished building the wall and put the doors in the gates, we chose the men who would guard the gates and the men to sing in the temple and help the priests.
next, i put my brother hanani in charge of jerusalem.
i chose another man named hananiah to be the commander of the fort.
i picked hanani because he was a very honest man and he feared god more than most people do.
then i said to hanani and hananiah, “each day you must wait until the sun has been up for several hours before you open the gates of jerusalem.
you must shut and lock the gates before the sun goes down.
also choose people who live in jerusalem as guards.
put some of them at special places to guard the city, and put the other people near their own houses.” 
now the city was large and there was plenty of room.
but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
so my god put it in my heart to have all the people meet together.
i called together all the important people, the officials, and the common people.
i did this so that i could make a list of all the families.
i found the family lists of the people who had been the first to return from captivity.
this is what i found written there: 
these are the people of the province who came back from captivity.
in the past, king nebuchadnezzar of babylon took them as prisoners to babylon.
these people came back to jerusalem and judah.
they all went to their own towns.
they returned with zerubbabel, jeshua, nehemiah, azariah, raamiah, nahamani, mordecai, bilshan, mispereth, bigvai, nehum, and baanah.
this is the list of names and numbers of men from israel who came back: 
the descendants of parosh 2172 
the descendants of shephatiah 372 
the descendants of arah 652 
the descendants of pahath moab of the family line of jeshua and joab 2818 
the descendants of elam 1254 
the descendants of zattu 845 
the descendants of zaccai 760 
the descendants of binnui 648 
the descendants of bebai 628 
the descendants of azgad 2322 
the descendants of adonikam 667 
the descendants of bigvai 2067 
the descendants of adin 655 
the descendants of ater through the family of hezekiah 98 
the descendants of hashum 328 
the descendants of bezai 324

from the town of beth azmaveth 42 
from the towns of kiriath jearim, kephirah, and beeroth 743

from the other town of nebo 52 
from the other town of elam 1254 
from the town of harim 320 
from the town of jericho 345 
from the towns of lod, hadid, and ono 721 
from the town of senaah 3930 
these are the priests: the descendants of jedaiah through the family of jeshua 973 
the descendants of immer 1052 
the descendants of pashhur 1247 
the descendants of harim 1017 
these are the people from the tribe of levi: the descendants of jeshua through kadmiel through the family of hodeiah 74 
these are the singers: the descendants of asaph 148 
these are the gatekeepers: the descendants of shallum, ater, talmon, akkub, hatita, and shobai 138 
these are the special temple servants: the descendants of ziha, hasupha, tabbaoth, 
keros, sia, padon, 
lebana, hagaba, shalmai, 
hanan, giddel, gaher, 
reaiah, rezin, nekoda, 
gazzam, uzza, paseah, 
besai, meunim, nephussim, 
bakbuk, hakupha, harhur, 
bazluth, mehida, harsha, 
barkos, sisera, temah, 
neziah, and hatipha.
these are the descendants of the servants of solomon: sotai, sophereth, perida, 
jaala, darkon, giddel, 
shephatiah, hattil, pokereth hazzebaim, and amon, 
the temple servants and the descendants of solomon’s servants 392 
some people came to jerusalem from these towns of tel melah, tel harsha, kerub, addon, and immer.
but these people could not prove that their families really came from the israelites: 
the descendants of delaiah, tobiah, and nekoda 642 
from the family of priests there were the descendants of hobaiah, hakkoz, and barzillai (if a man married a daughter of barzillai from gilead, he was counted as a descendant of barzillai.)
these people searched for their family histories, but they could not find them.
they could not prove that their ancestors were priests, so they could not serve as priests.
their names were not included in the list of priests.
the governor ordered them not to eat any of the most holy food until a priest could use the urim and thummim to ask god what to do.
all together, there were 42,360 people in the group who came back.
this is not counting their 7337 men and women slaves.
they also had 245 men and women singers with them.
they had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6720 donkeys.
some of the family leaders gave money to support the work.
the governor gave 19 pounds of gold to the treasury.
he also gave 50 bowls and 530 pieces of clothing for the priests.
the family leaders gave 375 pounds of gold to the treasury to support the work.
they also gave 2750 pounds of silver.
all together the other people gave 375 pounds of gold, 2500 pounds of silver, and 67 pieces of clothing for the priests.
so the priests, the people from the tribe of levi, the gatekeepers, the singers, and the temple servants settled down in their own towns.
and all the other israelites settled down in their own towns.
by the seventh month of the year, all the israelites had settled down in their own towns.
chapter 58.
shout as loud as you can and don’t stop.
shout like a trumpet!
tell the people what they did wrong.
tell the family of jacob about their sins.
they still come every day to worship me, acting as if they want to learn my ways.
they pretend to be a nation that lives right and obeys the commands of their god.
they ask me to judge them fairly.
they want their god to be near them.
they say, “we fast to show honor to you.
why don’t you see us?
we starve our bodies to show honor to you.
why don’t you notice us?” but god says, “you do things to please yourselves on those special days of fasting.
and you punish your servants, not your own bodies.
you are hungry, but not for food.
you are hungry for arguing and fighting, not for bread.
you are hungry to hit people with your evil hands.
this is not the way to fast if you want your prayers to be heard in heaven!
do you think i want to see people punish their bodies on those days of fasting?
do you think i want people to look sad and bow their heads like dead plants?
do you think i want people to wear mourning clothes and sit in ashes to show their sadness?
that is what you do on your days of fasting.
do you think that is what the lord wants?
“i will tell you the kind of day i want—a day to set people free.
i want a day that you take the burdens off others.
i want a day when you set troubled people free and you take the burdens from their shoulders.
i want you to share your food with the hungry.
i want you to find the poor who don’t have homes and bring them into your own homes.
when you see people who have no clothes, give them your clothes!
don’t hide from your relatives when they need help.” 
if you do these things, your light will begin to shine like the light of dawn.
then your wounds will heal.
your “goodness” will walk in front of you, and the glory of the lord will come following behind you.
then you will call to the lord, and he will answer you.
you will cry out to him, and he will say, “here i am.” stop causing trouble and putting burdens on people.
stop saying things to hurt people or accusing them of things they didn’t do.
feel sorry for hungry people and give them food.
help those who are troubled and satisfy their needs.
then your light will shine in the darkness.
you will be like the bright sunshine at noon.
the lord will always lead you and satisfy your needs in dry lands.
he will give strength to your bones.
you will be like a garden that has plenty of water, like a spring that never goes dry.
your cities have been destroyed for many years, but you will rebuild them and their foundations will last for a long time.
you will be called “fence fixer” and “builder of roads and houses.” 
that will happen when you stop sinning against god’s law about the sabbath and when you stop doing things to please yourself on that special day.
you should call the sabbath a happy day.
you should honor the lord’s special day by not saying and doing things that you do every other day of the week.
then you could enjoy the lord.
as the lord himself says, “i could carry you up to the highest mountain and let you enjoy the land that i gave to your father jacob.” 
ezekiel.
chapter 41.
then the man led me into the holy place.
he measured the walls on either side of the room.
the side walls were 6 cubits thick on each side.
the door was 10 cubits wide.
the sides of the doorway were 5 cubits on each side.
he measured that room.
it was 40 cubits long and 20 cubits wide.
then the man went into the last room.
he measured the walls on either side of the doorway.
each side wall was 2 cubits thick and 7 cubits wide.
the doorway was 6 cubits wide.
then he measured the length of the room.
it was 20 cubits long and 20 cubits wide.
he said to me, “this is the most holy place.” 
then the man measured the wall of the temple.
it was 6 cubits thick.
there were side rooms all around the temple.
they were 4 cubits wide.
the side rooms were on three different floors, one above the other.
there were 30 rooms on each floor.
the wall of the temple was built with ledges.
the side rooms rested on these ledges but were not connected to the temple wall itself.
each floor of the side rooms around the temple was wider than the floor below.
the walls of the rooms around the temple became narrower the higher they went so that the rooms on the top floors were wider.
a stairway went up from the lowest floor to the highest floor through the middle floor.
i also saw that the temple had a raised base all the way around it.
it was the foundation for the side rooms, and it was a full ruler high.
the outer wall of the side rooms was 5 cubits thick.
there was an open area between the side rooms of the temple 
and the priests’ rooms.
it was 20 cubits wide and went all the way around the temple.
the doors of the side rooms opened onto the raised base.
there was one entrance on the north side and one entrance on the south side.
the raised base was 5 cubits wide all around.
there was a building in this restricted area west of the temple.
the building was 70 cubits wide and 90 cubits long.
the wall of the building was 5 cubits thick all around.
then the man measured the temple.
the temple was 100 cubits long.
the restricted area, including the building and its walls, was also 100 cubits long.
the restricted area on the east side, in front of the temple, was 100 cubits long.
the man measured the length of the building in the restricted area at the rear of the temple.
it was 100 cubits from one wall to the other wall.
the most holy place, the holy place, and the porch by the courtyard 
had wood paneling on all the walls.
all the windows and doors had wood trim around them.
by the doorway, the temple had wood paneling from the floor up to the windows and up to the part of the wall 
over the doorway.
on all the walls in the inner room and the outer room of the temple were carvings 
of cherub angels and palm trees.
a palm tree was between each cherub angel.
every cherub angel had two faces.
one face was a man’s face looking toward the palm tree on one side.
the other face was a lion’s face looking toward the palm tree on the other side.
they were carved all around on the temple.
from the floor to the area above the door, cherub angels and palm trees were carved on all walls of the holy place.
the walls on either side of the holy place were square.
in front of the most holy place, there was something that looked like 
an altar made from wood.
it was 3 cubits high and 2 cubits long.
its corners, its base, and its sides were wood.
the man said to me, “this is the table that is before the lord.” 
both the holy place and the most holy place had a double door.
each of the doors was made from two smaller doors.
each door was really two swinging doors.
also cherub angels and palm trees were carved on the doors of the holy place.
they were like those carved on the walls.
there was a wood roof over the front of the porch.
there were windows with frames around them and palm trees on the walls on both sides of the porch, on the roof over the porch, and on the rooms around the temple.
chapter 11.
the lord said to moses and aaron, 
“tell the israelites: these are the animals you can eat: 
if an animal has hooves that are split into two parts, and if that animal also chews the cud, then you may eat the meat from that animal.
“some animals chew the cud, but they don’t have split hooves.
don’t eat these animals.
camels, rock badgers, and rabbits are like that, so they are unclean for you.
other animals have hooves that are split into two parts, but they don’t chew the cud.
don’t eat these animals.
pigs are like that, so they are unclean for you.
don’t eat the meat from these animals.
don’t even touch their dead bodies!
they are unclean for you.
“you may eat everything that lives in the sea or in a river that has fins and scales.
but you must not eat anything that lives in the sea or in a river and does not have fins and scales.
just the thought of eating such a creature should make you sick.
this will never change.
so don’t ever eat meat from anything like that.
don’t even touch its dead body!
it is a sickening thought for you to touch anything that lives in the water and does not have fins and scales.
“you must also treat some birds as things that are wrong to eat.
stay away from them.
it is a sickening thought for you to eat any of these birds: eagles, vultures, buzzards, 
kites, all kinds of falcons, 
all kinds of black birds, 
ostriches, nighthawks, sea gulls, all kinds of hawks, 
owls, cormorants, great owls, 
water hens, pelicans, carrion vultures, 
storks, all kinds of herons, hoopoes, and bats.
“don’t eat insects that have wings and crawl.
even the thought of eating them should make you sick!
but you may eat insects if they have legs with joints above their feet so that they can jump.
you may also eat all kinds of locusts, all kinds of winged locusts, all kinds of crickets, and all kinds of grasshoppers.
“but stay away from all the other insects that have wings and crawl.
they will make you unclean.
if you touch the dead bodies of these insects, you will become unclean until evening.
if you pick up one of these dead insects, you must wash your clothes.
you will be unclean until evening.
“some animals have split hooves, but the hooves don’t make exactly two parts.
some animals don’t chew the cud.
some animals don’t have hooves—they walk on their paws.
all these animals are unclean for you.
if you touch them, you will become unclean until evening.
if you pick up the dead bodies of these unclean animals, you must wash your clothes.
you will be unclean until evening.
these animals are unclean for you.
“these small animals are unclean for you: moles, mice, all kinds of great lizards, 
geckos, crocodiles, lizards, sand reptiles, and chameleons.
whoever touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening.
“if any of these unclean animals dies and falls on something, that thing will become unclean.
it might be something made from wood, cloth, leather, or sackcloth.
whatever it is or is used for, it must be washed with water.
it will be unclean until evening.
then it will become clean again.
if any of these unclean animals dies and falls into a clay dish, anything in the dish will become unclean.
and you must break the dish.
if water from the unclean clay dish touches any food, that food will become unclean.
any drink in the unclean dish will become unclean.
if any part of a dead, unclean animal falls on something, that thing is unclean.
it may be a clay oven or a clay baking pan.
it must be broken into pieces.
these things will remain unclean.
they will always be unclean for you.
“a spring or a well that collects water will remain clean, but anyone who touches the dead bodies of any unclean animal in that water will become unclean.
if any part of a dead, unclean animal falls on seed that is to be planted, that seed is still clean.
but if you put water on some seed and if any part of a dead, unclean animal falls on those seeds, they are unclean for you.
“also, if an animal which you use for food dies, whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until evening.
if you eat meat from this animal’s body, you must wash your clothes.
you will be unclean until evening.
if you pick up the dead body of the animal, you must wash your clothes.
you will be unclean until evening.
“you must treat all the crawling animals that live on the dirt as disgusting things that you must not eat.
you must not eat any of the reptiles that crawl on their bellies or that walk on all four feet or that have many feet.
don’t eat these animals!
don’t let them make you filthy.
you must not become unclean, 
because i am the lord your god.
i am holy, so you should keep yourselves holy.
don’t make yourselves unclean with these crawling things.
i, the lord, brought you out of egypt so that you could be my special people and i could be your god.
i am holy, so you must be holy too.” 
these are the rules about all the tame animals, birds, all the animals in the sea, and all the animals that crawl on the ground.
these rules will help the people know which animals are unclean and which animals they are allowed to eat and which ones they cannot eat.
chapter 134.
a song for going up to the temple.
praise the lord, all his servants who serve in the temple at night.
lift your hands toward the temple, and praise the lord.
may the lord, who made heaven and earth, bless you from zion.
chapter 19.
the lord said to moses, 
“tell all the israelites: i am the lord your god.
i am holy, so you must be holy.
“each of you must honor your mother and father and keep my special days of rest.
i am the lord your god!
“do not worship idols.
do not make statues of gods for yourselves.
i am the lord your god.
“when you offer a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the lord, you must offer it in the right way so that you will be accepted.
you may eat it the same day you offer it and on the next day.
but if any of that sacrifice is left on the third day, you must burn it in the fire.
you must not eat any of that sacrifice on the third day.
it will be unclean, and it will not be accepted.
you will be guilty of sin if you do that because you did not respect the holy things that belong to the lord.
if you do that, you will be separated from your people.
“when you cut your crops at harvest time, don’t cut all the way to the corners of your fields.
and if grain falls on the ground, you must not gather up that grain.
don’t pick all the grapes in your vineyards or pick up the grapes that fall to the ground.
you must leave those things for your poor people and for people traveling through your country.
i am the lord your god.
“you must not steal.
you must not cheat people.
you must not lie to each other.
you must not use my name to make false promises.
if you do that, you will show that you don’t respect the name of your god.
i am the lord!
“you must not cheat or rob your neighbor.
you must not hold a hired worker’s salary overnight until morning.
“you must not curse anyone who is deaf.
you must not do anything to make a blind person fall.
but you must respect your god.
i am the lord.
“you must be fair in judgment.
you must not show special favor to the poor.
and you must not show special favor to important people.
you must be fair when you judge your neighbor.
you must not go around spreading false stories against other people.
don’t do anything that would put your neighbor’s life in danger.
i am the lord.
“don’t secretly hate any of your neighbors.
but tell them openly what they have done wrong so that you will not be just as guilty of sin as they are.
forget about the wrong things people do to you.
don’t try to get even.
love your neighbor as yourself.
i am the lord.
“you must obey my laws.
you must not let your animals mate with animals of a different kind.
you must not sow your field with two kinds of seed.
you must not wear clothing made from two kinds of material mixed together.
“it may happen that a man has sexual relations with a woman who is the slave of another man.
but this slave woman has not been bought or given her freedom.
if this happens, there must be punishment.
but they will not be put to death because the woman was not free.
the man must bring his guilt offering to the lord at the entrance of the meeting tent.
he must bring a ram for a guilt offering.
the priest will make him pure by offering the ram as a guilt offering before the lord.
the offering is for the man’s sins, which will then be forgiven.
“in the future, when you enter your country, you will plant many kinds of trees for food.
after planting a tree, you must wait three years before you can use any of the fruit from that tree.
you must not use that fruit.
in the fourth year, the fruit from that tree will belong to the lord, a holy offering of praise to him.
then, in the fifth year, you can eat the fruit from that tree.
and the tree will produce more and more fruit for you.
i am the lord your god.
“you must not eat any meat with blood still in it.
“you must not try to use different kinds of magic to tell the future.
“you must not round off the hair that grows on the side of your face.
you must not cut your beard that grows on the side of your face.
you must not cut your body as a way to remember the dead.
you must not make any tattoo marks on yourselves.
i am the lord.
“do not dishonor your daughters by making them become prostitutes.
if you do that, your whole country will turn away from god and be filled with all kinds of sinful things.
“you must not work on my special days of rest.
you must honor my holy place.
i am the lord.
“do not go to mediums or wizards for advice—they will only make you unclean.
i am the lord your god.
“show honor to old people.
stand up when they come into the room.
and show respect to your leaders.
i am the lord.
“do not do bad things to foreigners living in your country.
you must treat them the same as you treat your own citizens.
love them as you love yourselves.
remember, you were foreigners in egypt.
i am the lord your god!
“you must be fair when you judge people, and you must be fair when you measure and weigh things.
your baskets should be the right size.
your jars should hold the right amount of liquids.
your weights and balances should weigh things correctly.
i am the lord your god.
i brought you out of the land of egypt.
“you must remember all my laws and rules.
and you must obey them.
i am the lord.” 
jeremiah.
chapter 46.
these messages about different nations came to jeremiah the prophet from the lord.
this message is about the nation of egypt.
it is about the army of pharaoh neco king of egypt.
his army was defeated at the town of carchemish.
carchemish is on the euphrates river.
king nebuchadnezzar of babylon defeated the army of pharaoh neco at carchemish in the fourth year that jehoiakim son of josiah was king of judah.
the lord said, 
“get your large and small shields ready.
march out for battle.
get the horses ready.
soldiers, get on your horses.
go to your places for battle.
put your helmets on.
sharpen your spears.
put your armor on.
what do i see?
that army is afraid.
the soldiers are running away.
their brave soldiers are defeated.
they run away in a hurry.
they don’t look back.
there is danger all around.” this is what the lord said.
“fast men cannot run away.
strong soldiers cannot escape.
they will all stumble and fall.
this will happen in the north, by the euphrates river.
who is coming like the nile river?
who is coming like that strong, fast river?
it is egypt that comes like the rising nile river.
it is egypt that comes like that strong, fast river.
egypt says, ‘i will come and cover the earth.
i will destroy the cities and the people in them.’ 
horse soldiers, charge into battle.
chariot drivers, drive fast.
march on, brave soldiers.
soldiers from cush and put, carry your shields.
soldiers from lydia, use your bows.
“but on that day, the lord god all-powerful will win.
he will give his enemies the punishment they deserve.
his sword will kill until it is finished, until it has satisfied its thirst for blood.
yes, the lord god all-powerful will kill them as a sacrifice in the land of the north by the euphrates river.
“egypt, go to gilead and get some medicine.
you will make up many medicines, but they will not help.
you will not be healed.
the nations will hear you crying.
your cries will be heard all over the earth.
one ‘brave soldier’ will run into another ‘brave soldier.’ and both ‘brave soldiers’ will fall down together.” 
this is the message the lord spoke to jeremiah the prophet about nebuchadnezzar coming to attack egypt.
“announce this message in egypt.
tell it in the city of migdol.
tell it in memphis and tahpanhes.
‘get ready for war, because people all around you are being killed with swords.’ 
egypt, your strong soldiers will be killed.
they will not be able to stand because the lord will push them down.
they will stumble again and again.
they will fall over each other.
they will say, ‘get up; let’s go back to our own people.
let us go back to our homeland.
our enemy is defeating us.
we must get away.’ 
in their homelands, those soldiers will say, ‘pharaoh, the king of egypt, is only a lot of noise.
his time of glory is over.’” 
this message is from the king.
the king is the lord all-powerful.
“i promise, as surely as i live, a powerful leader will come.
he will be like mount tabor or mount carmel among smaller mountains.
people of egypt, pack your things.
get ready for captivity, because memphis will be a ruined, empty land.
those cities will be destroyed, and no one will live there.
“egypt is like a beautiful cow.
but a horsefly is coming from the north to attack her.
the hired soldiers in egypt’s army are like fat calves.
they will all turn and run away.
they will not stand strong against the attack.
their time of destruction is coming.
they will soon be punished.
egypt is like a snake hissing and trying to escape.
the enemy comes closer and closer, and the egyptian army is trying to slither away.
the enemy will attack egypt with axes, like men cutting down trees.” 
this is what the lord says: “they will chop down egypt’s forest.
there are many trees in that forest, but they will all be cut down.
there are more enemy soldiers than locusts.
there are so many soldiers that no one can count them.
egypt will be ashamed.
the enemy from the north will defeat her.” 
the lord all-powerful, the god of israel, says, “very soon i will punish amon, the god of thebes, and i will punish pharaoh, egypt, and her gods.
i will punish the kings of egypt, and i will punish the people who depend on pharaoh.
i will let all of them be defeated by their enemies—their enemies want to kill them.
i will give the people to king nebuchadnezzar of babylon and his servants.
“long ago, egypt lived in peace.
and after all these times of trouble, egypt will live in peace again.” this is what the lord said.
“jacob, my servant, do not be afraid.
do not be frightened, israel.
i will save you from those faraway places.
i will save your children from the countries where they are captives.
jacob will have peace and safety again, and no one will make him afraid.” 
this is what the lord says.
“jacob, my servant, do not be afraid.
i am with you.
i sent you away to many different places.
but i will not destroy you completely.
but i will destroy all those nations.
you must be punished for the bad things you did.
so i will not let you escape your punishment.
i will discipline you, but i will be fair.” 
isaiah.
chapter 19.
a message about egypt: look, the lord is coming on a fast cloud.
he will enter egypt, and all the false gods of egypt will shake with fear.
egypt’s courage will melt away like hot wax.
the lord says, “i will cause the egyptians to fight against themselves.
men will fight their brothers.
neighbors will be against neighbors.
cities will be against cities.
kingdoms will be against kingdoms.
the egyptians will be afraid and confused.
they will ask their false gods and wise men what they should do.
they will ask their wizards and magicians, but i will ruin their plans.” 
the lord god all-powerful says, “i will give egypt to a hard master.
a powerful king will rule over the people.” 
the water in the nile river will dry up and disappear.
all the rivers will smell very bad.
the canals in egypt will be dry, and the water will be gone.
all the water plants will rot.
all the plants along the riverbanks will die and blow away.
even the plants at the widest part of the river will dry up, blow away, and disappear.
the fishermen, all those who catch fish from the nile river, will become sad and they will cry.
they depend on the nile river for their food, but it will be dry.
those who make cloth from flax, who weave it into linen, will all be sad.
those who weave cloth will be broken, and those who work for money will be depressed.
the leaders of the city of zoan are fools.
pharaoh’s “wise advisors” give bad advice.
they say they are wise.
they say they are from the old family of the kings, but they are not as smart as they think.
egypt, where are your wise men?
they should learn what the lord all-powerful has planned for egypt.
they should be the ones to tell you what will happen.
the leaders of zoan have been fooled.
the leaders of noph have believed lies, so they lead egypt the wrong way.
the lord confused them, so they wander around and lead egypt the wrong way.
everything they do is wrong.
they are like drunks rolling in their vomit.
there is nothing the leaders can do.
(they are “the heads and the tails.” they are “the tops and the stalks of plants.”) 
at that time the egyptians will be like frightened women.
they will be afraid of the lord all-powerful, because he will raise his arm to punish the people.
the land of judah brings fear to everyone in egypt.
anyone in egypt who hears the name judah will be afraid.
this will happen because the lord all-powerful has planned terrible things to happen to egypt.
at that time there will be five cities in egypt where people speak hebrew.
one of these cities will be named “destruction city.” the people in these cities will promise to follow the lord all-powerful.
at that time there will be an altar for the lord in the middle of egypt.
at the border of egypt there will be a monument to show honor to the lord.
this will be a sign to show that the lord all-powerful does amazing things.
any time the people cry for help from the lord, he will send help.
he will send someone to save and defend the people—to rescue the people from those who hurt them.
at that time the lord will make himself known to the egyptians, and they really will know the lord.
they will serve him and give him many sacrifices.
they will make promises to the lord, and they will do what they promise.
the lord will punish the egyptians, but then he will heal them, and they will come back to him.
the lord will listen to their prayers and heal them.
at that time there will be a highway from egypt to assyria.
then the assyrians will go to egypt, and the egyptians will go to assyria.
egypt will work with assyria.
then israel, assyria, and egypt will join together and control the land.
this will be a blessing for the land.
the lord all-powerful will bless these countries.
he will say, “egypt, you are my people.
assyria, i made you.
israel, i own you.
you are all blessed!” 
haggai.
chapter 1.
on the first day of the sixth month of the second year that darius was king of persia, haggai received a message from the lord.
this message was for zerubbabel son of shealtiel and joshua son of jehozadak.
zerubbabel was the governor of judah and joshua was the high priest.
this is the message: 
this is what the lord all-powerful said, “the people say it is not yet the right time to build the lord’s temple.” 
again haggai received a message from the lord.
haggai spoke this message: 
“you people think the right time has come for you to live in nice houses.
you live in houses with beautiful wooden paneling on the walls, but the lord’s house is still in ruins.
now the lord all-powerful says, ‘think about what is happening.
you have planted many seeds, but you have gathered only a few crops.
you have food to eat, but not enough to get full.
you have something to drink, but not enough to get drunk.
you have some clothes to wear, but not enough to keep warm.
you earn a little money, but you don’t know where it all goes.
it’s as though there is a hole in your pocket!’” 
the lord all-powerful said, “think about what you are doing.
go up to the mountains, get the wood, and build the temple.
then i will be pleased with the temple, and i will be honored.” this is what the lord said.
the lord all-powerful said, “you people look for a big harvest, but when you go to gather the crop, there is only a little grain.
so you bring that grain home, and then i send a wind that blows it all away.
why is this happening?
because my house is still in ruins while each of you runs home to take care of your own house.
that is why the sky holds back its dew and why the earth holds back its crops.
“i gave the command for the land and the mountains to be dry.
the grain, the new wine, the olive oil, and everything the earth produces will be ruined.
all the people and all the animals will become weak.” 
the lord god had sent haggai to speak to zerubbabel son of shealtiel and to the high priest, joshua son of jehozadak.
so these men and all the people listened to the voice of the lord their god and to the words of haggai the prophet.
and the people showed their fear and respect for the lord their god.
then haggai, the lord’s messenger, delivered this message to the people: “the lord says, ‘i am with you!’” 
zerubbabel son of shealtiel was the governor of judah.
joshua son of jehozadak was the high priest.
the lord made them and the rest of the people excited about working on the temple of their god, the lord all-powerful.
so they began this work on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year darius was the king.
chapter 29.
then jacob continued his trip.
he went to the country in the east.
he looked and saw a well in the field.
there were three flocks of sheep lying near the well, where the sheep drank water.
there was a large rock covering the mouth of the well.
when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the rock away from the well.
then all the sheep could drink from the water.
after the sheep were full, the shepherds would put the rock back in its place.
jacob said to the shepherds there, “brothers, where are you from?” they answered, “we are from haran.” 
then jacob said, “do you know laban, the son of nahor?” the shepherds answered, “we know him.” 
then jacob said, “how is he?” they answered, “he is well.
look, that is his daughter rachel coming now with his sheep.” 
jacob said, “look, it is still day and long before the sun sets.
it is not yet time for the animals to be gathered together for the night.
so give them water and let them go back into the field.” 
but they said, “we cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered together.
then we will move the rock from the well, and all the sheep will drink.” 
while jacob was talking with the shepherds, rachel came with her father’s sheep.
(it was her job to take care of the sheep.)
rachel was laban’s daughter.
laban was the brother of rebekah, jacob’s mother.
when jacob saw rachel, he went and moved the rock and gave water to the sheep.
then jacob kissed rachel and cried.
he told her that he was from her father’s family.
he told her that he was the son of rebekah.
so rachel ran home and told her father.
when laban heard the news about his sister’s son jacob, he ran to meet him.
laban hugged him and kissed him and brought him to his house.
jacob told laban everything that had happened.
then laban said, “this is wonderful!
you are from my own family.” so jacob stayed with laban for a month.
one day laban said to jacob, “you are a relative of mine.
it is not right for you to continue working for me without pay.
what should i pay you?” 
now laban had two daughters.
the older was leah and the younger was rachel.
leah’s eyes were gentle, but rachel was beautiful.
jacob loved rachel, so he said to laban, “i will work seven years for you if you will allow me to marry your daughter rachel.” 
laban said, “it would be better for her to marry you than someone else.
so stay with me.” 
so jacob stayed and worked for laban for seven years.
but it seemed like a very short time because he loved rachel very much.
after seven years jacob said to laban, “give me rachel so that i can marry her.
my time of work for you is finished.” 
so laban gave a party for all the people in that place.
that night laban brought his daughter leah to jacob.
jacob and leah had sexual relations together.
(laban gave his maid zilpah to his daughter to be her maid.)
in the morning jacob saw that it was leah he had slept with, and he said to laban, “you have tricked me.
i worked hard for you so that i could marry rachel.
why did you trick me?” 
laban said, “in our country we don’t allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter.
continue for the full week of the marriage ceremony, and i will also give you rachel to marry.
but you must serve me another seven years.” 
so jacob did this and finished the week.
then laban gave him his daughter rachel as a wife.
(laban gave his maid bilhah to his daughter rachel to be her maid.)
so jacob had sexual relations with rachel also.
and jacob loved rachel more than leah.
jacob worked for laban for another seven years.
the lord saw that jacob loved rachel more than leah, so he made it possible for leah to have children.
but rachel did not have any children.
leah gave birth to a son, and she named him reuben.
she named him this because she said, “the lord has seen my troubles.
my husband does not love me.
so now maybe my husband will love me.” 
leah became pregnant again and had another son.
she named this son simeon.
she said, “the lord has heard that i am not loved, so he gave me this son.” 
leah became pregnant again and had another son.
she named this son levi.
she said, “now, surely my husband will love me.
i have given him three sons.” 
then leah gave birth to another son.
she named this son judah.
leah named him this because she said, “now i will praise the lord.” then leah stopped having children.
chapter 15.
at the time of the wheat harvest, samson went to visit his wife.
he took a young goat with him as a gift.
he said, “i am going to my wife’s room.” but her father would not let samson go in.
he said, “i thought you hated her, so i let her marry the best man at the wedding.
her younger sister is more beautiful.
take her younger sister.” 
but samson said to him, “now i have a good reason to hurt you philistines.
no one will blame me now.” 
so samson went out and caught 300 foxes.
he took two foxes at a time and tied their tails together to make pairs.
then he tied a torch between the tails of each pair of foxes.
he lit the torches that were between the foxes’ tails and let them run through the grain fields of the philistines.
in this way he burned up the plants growing in their fields and the stacks of grain they had cut.
he also burned up their vineyards and their olive trees.
the philistines asked, “who did this?” someone told them, “samson, the son-in-law of the man from timnah, did this.
he did this because his father-in-law gave samson’s wife to the best man at his wedding.” so the philistines burned samson’s wife and her father to death.
then samson said to the philistines, “you did this bad thing to me, so now i will do bad things to you.
then i will be finished with you!” 
samson attacked the philistines and killed many of them.
then he went and stayed in a cave in a place named the rock of etam.
the philistines went to the land of judah and stopped near a place named lehi.
their army camped there.
the men of the tribe of judah asked them, “why have you philistines come here to fight us?” they answered, “we have come to get samson.
we want to make him our prisoner.
we want to punish him for what he has done to our people.” 
then 3000 men from the tribe of judah went to the cave near the rock of etam and said to samson, “what have you done to us?
don’t you know that the philistines rule over us?” samson answered, “i only punished them for what they did to me.” 
then they said to samson, “we have come to tie you up.
we will give you to the philistines.” samson said to the men from judah, “promise me that you yourselves will not hurt me.” 
the men from judah said, “we agree.
we will just tie you up and give you to the philistines.
we promise that we will not kill you.” so they tied samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock.
when samson came to the place called lehi, the philistines came to meet him.
they were shouting with joy.
then the spirit of the lord came on samson with great power.
samson broke the ropes—they were like burned strings falling from his arms and the ropes on his hands seemed to melt away.
samson found a jawbone of a dead donkey and killed 1000 philistine men with it.
then samson said, “with a donkey’s jawbone, i killed 1000 men!
with a donkey’s jawbone, i piled them into a tall pile.” 
when samson finished speaking, he threw the jawbone down.
so that place was named ramath lehi.
samson was very thirsty.
so he cried to the lord.
he said, “i am your servant.
you gave me this great victory.
please don’t let me die from thirst now.
please don’t let me be captured by men who are not even circumcised.” 
there is a hole in the ground at lehi.
god made that hole crack open, and water came out.
samson drank the water and felt better.
he felt strong again.
so he named that water spring en hakkore.
it is still there in the city of lehi today.
samson was a judge for the israelites for 20 years during the time of the philistines.
chapter 1.
this is the vision of obadiah.
this is what the lord god says about edom: we heard a report from the lord.
a messenger was sent to the nations.
he said, “let’s go fight against edom.” 
“edom, i will make you the smallest nation.
everyone will hate you very much.
your pride has fooled you.
you live in those caves high on the cliff.
your home is high in the hills.
so you say to yourself, ‘no one can bring me to the ground.’” 
this is what the lord says: “even though you fly high like the eagle and put your nest among the stars, i will bring you down from there.
you really will be ruined!
thieves will come to you.
robbers will come in the night, and they will take all they want.
when workers gather grapes in your vineyards, they will leave a few grapes behind.
but the enemy will search hard for esau’s hidden treasures, and they will find them all.
all those who are your friends will force you out of the land.
those who were at peace with you will trick you, and they will defeat you.
the soldiers who fought by your side are planning a trap for you.
they say, ‘he doesn’t expect a thing!’” 
the lord says, “on that day i will destroy the wise people from edom.
i will destroy the intelligent people from the mountain of esau.
teman, your brave soldiers will be afraid.
everyone will be destroyed from the mountain of esau.
many people will be killed.
you will be covered with shame because you were very cruel to your brother jacob.
so you will be destroyed completely.
you joined the enemies of israel.
strangers carried israel’s treasures away.
foreigners entered israel’s city gate.
they threw lots to decide what part of jerusalem they would get.
and you were right there with them, waiting to get your share.
you should not have laughed at your brother’s trouble.
you should not have been happy when they destroyed judah.
you should not have bragged at the time of their trouble.
you should not have entered the city gate of my people and laughed at their problems.
you should not have taken their treasures in the time of their trouble.
you should not have stood where the roads cross and destroyed those who were trying to escape.
you should not have captured those who escaped alive.
the day of the lord is coming soon to all the nations.
and the evil you did to others will happen to you.
the same bad things will fall down on your own head.
you spilled blood on my holy mountain, so other nations will spill your blood.
you will be finished.
it will be as if you never existed.
but there will be survivors on mount zion.
they will be my special people.
the nation of jacob will take back what belongs to it.
the family of jacob will be like a fire.
the nation of joseph will be like a flame.
but the nation of esau will be like ashes.
the people of judah will burn edom, and they will destroy it.
then there will be no survivors in the nation of esau.” this will happen because the lord said it would.
then people from the negev will live on the mountain of esau.
and people from the foothills will take the philistine lands.
they will live in the land of ephraim and samaria.
gilead will belong to benjamin.
people from israel were forced to leave their homes, but they will take back the land of canaan, all the way to zarephath.
people from judah were forced to leave jerusalem and live in sepharad.
but they will take back the cities of the negev.
the winners will go up on mount zion to rule the people who live on esau’s mountain.
and the kingdom will belong to the lord.
chapter 8.
“you must obey all the commands that i give you today, because then you will live and grow to become a great nation.
you will get the land that the lord promised to your ancestors.
and you must remember the entire trip that the lord your god has led you through these 40 years in the desert.
he was testing you.
he wanted to make you humble.
he wanted to know what is in your heart.
he wanted to know if you would obey his commands.
he humbled you and let you be hungry.
then he fed you with manna—something you did not know about before.
it was something your ancestors had never seen.
why did the lord do this?
because he wanted you to know that it is not just bread that keeps people alive.
people’s lives depend on what the lord says.
these past 40 years, your clothes did not wear out, and your feet did not swell.
you must remember that the lord your god teaches and corrects you as a father teaches and corrects his son.
“you must obey the commands of the lord your god.
follow him and respect him.
the lord your god is bringing you into a good land—a land with rivers and pools of water.
water flows out of the ground in the valleys and hills.
it is a land with wheat and barley, grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates.
it is a land with olive oil and honey.
there you will have plenty of food and everything you need.
it is a land where the rocks are iron.
you can dig copper out of the hills.
you will have all you want to eat.
then you will praise the lord your god for the good land he has given you.
“be careful.
don’t forget the lord your god!
be careful to obey the commands, laws, and rules that i give you today.
then you will have plenty to eat, and you will build good houses and live in them.
your cattle, sheep, and goats will grow large.
you will get plenty of gold and silver.
you will have plenty of everything.
when that happens, you must be careful not to become proud.
you must not forget the lord your god.
you were slaves in egypt, but he made you free and brought you out of that land.
he led you through that great and terrible desert where there were poisonous snakes and scorpions.
the ground was dry, and there was no water anywhere.
but he gave you water out of a solid rock.
in the desert he fed you manna—something your ancestors had never seen.
he tested you to make you humble so that everything would go well for you in the end.
don’t ever say to yourself, ‘i got all this wealth by my own power and ability.’ 
remember the lord your god is the one who gives you power to do these things.
he does this because he wants to keep the agreement that he made with your ancestors, as he is doing today!
“don’t ever forget the lord your god.
don’t ever follow other gods or worship and serve them.
if you do that, i warn you today: you will surely be destroyed!
the lord is destroying other nations for you.
but if you stop listening to the lord your god, you will be destroyed just like them!
chapter 1.
so the lord called out to moses from inside the meeting tent and said, 
“tell the israelites: when you bring an offering to the lord, the offering must be one of your tame animals—it can be a sheep, a goat, or one of your cattle.
“if you offer one of your cattle as a burnt offering, it must be a bull that has nothing wrong with it.
you must take the animal to the entrance of the meeting tent where the lord will accept the offering.
you must put your hand on the animal’s head while it is being killed.
so the lord will accept it as your burnt offering to make you pure.
“you must kill the young bull in front of the lord.
then aaron’s sons, the priests, will bring the blood to the altar that is near the entrance of the meeting tent.
he will splash the blood on all four sides of the altar.
you must remove the skin from that animal and then cut the animal into pieces.
aaron’s sons, the priests, will put the fire on the altar and arrange the wood on the fire.
they will lay the pieces of the animal, including the head and fat, on top of the burning wood.
you must wash the legs and inner parts of the animal with water.
then the priest will bring all these parts to the altar to be offered as a burnt offering, a sweet-smelling gift to the lord.
“if you offer a sheep or a goat as a burnt offering, it must be a male that has nothing wrong with it.
you must kill the animal on the north side of the altar in front of the lord.
then aaron’s sons, the priests, will splash the animal’s blood on all four sides of the altar.
you must cut the animal into pieces and remove the head and the fat.
the priest will then lay them on the wood that is on the fire of the altar.
you must wash the legs and inner parts of the animal with water.
then the priest will bring all these parts to the altar to be offered as a burnt offering, a sweet-smelling gift to the lord.
“if you offer a bird as a burnt offering to the lord, that bird must be a dove or a young pigeon.
the priest will bring the offering to the altar.
there the priest will remove the bird’s head, drain out the blood on the side of the altar, and burn the bird on the altar.
he will remove the bird’s tail and inner parts and throw them onto the pile of ashes east of the altar.
then the priest will tear the bird open by its wings, but he must not divide it completely into two parts.
so he will bring the bird to the altar to be offered as a burnt offering, a sweet-smelling gift to the lord.
chapter 16.
sarai was abram’s wife, but she did not have any children.
she had an egyptian slave named hagar.
sarai told abram, “the lord has not allowed me to have children, so sleep with my slave.
maybe she can have a son, and i will accept him as my own.” abram did what sarai said.
so after living ten years in the land of canaan, sarai gave her egyptian slave to abram as a second wife.
abram slept with hagar, and she became pregnant.
when hagar realized this, she became very proud and began to feel that she was better than sarai her owner.
then sarai said to abram, “my slave girl now hates me, and i blame you for this.
i gave her to you, and she became pregnant.
then she began to feel that she is better than i am.
i want the lord to judge which of us is right.” 
but abram said to sarai, “she is your slave.
you can do anything you want to her.” so sarai was cruel to hagar, and hagar ran away.
the angel of the lord found hagar near a spring of water in the desert.
the spring was by the road to shur.
the angel said, “hagar, sarai’s slave girl, why are you here?
where are you going?” hagar said, “i am running away from sarai.” 
the angel of the lord said to her, “sarai is your owner.
go home to her and obey her.” 
the angel of the lord also said, “from you will come many people—too many people to count.” 
then the angel of the lord said, “hagar, you are now pregnant, and you will have a son.
you will name him ishmael, because the lord has heard that you were treated badly.
ishmael will be wild and free like a wild donkey.
he will be against everyone, and everyone will be against him.
he will move from place to place and camp near his brothers.” 
the lord talked to hagar.
she began to use a new name for god.
she said to him, “you are ‘god who sees me.’” she said this because she thought, “i see that even in this place god sees me and cares for me!” 
so the well there was called beer lahai roi.
it is between kadesh and bered.
hagar gave birth to abram’s son, and abram named the son ishmael.
abram was 86 years old when ishmael was born from hagar.
chapter 75.
to the director: to the tune “don’t destroy.” one of asaph’s songs of praise.
we praise you, god!
we praise you because you are near to us.
we tell about the amazing things you have done.
god says, “i have chosen a time for judgment, and i will judge fairly.
the earth and all its people may shake, but i am the one who keeps it steady.
selah 
“to those who are proud i say, ‘stop your boasting.’ i warn the wicked, ‘don’t brag about how strong you are.
don’t be so sure that you will win.
don’t boast that victory is yours!’” 
there is no power on earth that can make a person important.
god is the judge.
he decides who will be important.
he lifts one person up and brings another down.
the lord has a cup in his hand.
it is filled with the poisoned wine of his anger.
he will pour out this wine, and the wicked will drink it to the last drop.
i will always tell people how great god is.
i will sing praise to the god of jacob.
god says, “i will take away any power the wicked have and give it to those who are good.” 
jeremiah.
chapter 41.
in the seventh month, ishmael son of nethaniah (the son of elishama) came to gedaliah son of ahikam.
ishmael came with ten of his men.
they came to the town of mizpah.
ishmael was a member of the king’s family.
he had been one of the officers of the king of judah.
ishmael and his men ate a meal with gedaliah.
while they were eating together, ishmael and his ten men got up and killed gedaliah son of ahikam with a sword.
gedaliah was the man the king of babylon had chosen to be governor of judah.
ishmael also killed all the men of judah who were with gedaliah at the town of mizpah.
he also killed the babylonian soldiers who were there with gedaliah.
the day after gedaliah was murdered, 80 men came to mizpah.
they were bringing grain offerings and incense to the lord’s temple.
they had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves.
they came from shechem, shiloh, and samaria.
none of these men knew that gedaliah had been murdered.
ishmael left mizpah and went to meet the 80 men.
he cried while he walked out to meet them.
ishmael met them and said, “come with me to meet with gedaliah son of ahikam.” 
as soon as they were in the city, ishmael and the men with him began to kill the 80 men and throw them into a deep cistern!
but ten of the men said to ishmael, “don’t kill us!
we have hidden some things in a field.
we have wheat and barley and oil and honey.” so ishmael stopped and didn’t kill them with the others.
(ishmael threw the dead bodies into the cistern until it was full, and that cistern was very big!
it had been built by a king of judah named asa.
king asa had made the cistern so that during war there would be water in the city.
asa did this to protect his city from king baasha of israel.)
ishmael captured all the other people in the town of mizpah and started to cross over to the country of the ammonites.
they included the king’s daughters, and all those who were left there.
nebuzaradan, the commander of the king of babylon’s special guards, had chosen gedaliah to watch over those people.
johanan son of kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the evil things ishmael had done.
so johanan and the army officers with him took their men and went to fight ishmael son of nethaniah.
they caught ishmael near the big pool of water that is at the town of gibeon.
when the captives that ishmael had taken saw johanan and the army officers, they were very happy.
then all the captives who ishmael had taken from the town of mizpah ran to johanan son of kareah.
but ishmael and eight of his men escaped from johanan and ran away to the ammonites.
so johanan son of kareah and all his army officers rescued the captives.
ishmael had murdered gedaliah and then he had taken those people from mizpah.
among the survivors were soldiers, women, children, and court officials.
johanan brought them back from the town of gibeon.
johanan and the other army officers were afraid of the chaldeans.
the king of babylon had chosen gedaliah to be governor of judah.
but ishmael murdered gedaliah, and johanan was afraid that the chaldeans would be angry.
so they decided to run away to egypt.
on the way to egypt, they stayed at geruth kimham, near the town of bethlehem.
chapter 4.
at that time seven women will grab one man and say, “please marry us!
we will supply our own food and make our own clothes.
you won’t have to do anything else if you let us wear your name and take away our shame.” 
at that time the lord’s plant will be very beautiful and glorious.
the people in israel who survived will be very proud of what the land grows.
and all those who are left in zion and jerusalem will be called holy.
their names were on the list of people in jerusalem who were allowed to live.
the lord will wash away the filth from the daughters of zion.
he will wash away the blood from jerusalem.
with a spirit of judgment that burns like fire, he will make everything pure.
then the lord will create a cloud of smoke in the day and a bright flame of fire at night over every building and over every meeting of the people on the mountain of zion.
and there will be a covering over everyone for protection.
it will be a shelter to protect the people from the heat of the sun and from all kinds of storms and rain.
chapter 17.
the israelites left the western sinai desert.
they traveled all together from place to place as the lord commanded.
they camped at rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
so they turned against moses and started arguing with him.
they said, “give us water to drink.” moses said to them, “why have you turned against me?
why are you testing the lord?” 
but the people were very thirsty, so they continued complaining to moses.
they said, “why did you bring us out of egypt?
did you bring us out here so that we, our children, and our cattle will all die without water?” 
so moses cried to the lord, “what can i do with these people?
they are ready to kill me.” 
the lord said to moses, “go before the israelites.
take some of the elders of the people with you.
carry your walking stick with you.
this is the stick that you used when you hit the nile river.
i will stand before you on a rock at horeb.
hit that rock with the walking stick and water will come out of it.
then the people can drink.” moses did these things and the elders of israel saw it.
moses named that place meribah and massah, because this was the place that the israelites turned against him and tested the lord.
the people wanted to know if the lord was with them or not.
at rephidim the amalekites came and fought against the israelites.
so moses said to joshua, “choose some men and go and fight the amalekites tomorrow.
i will stand on the top of the hill and watch you.
i will be holding the walking stick god gave me.” 
joshua obeyed moses and went to fight the amalekites the next day.
at the same time moses, aaron, and hur went to the top of the hill.
any time moses held his hands in the air, the men of israel would start winning the fight.
but when moses put his hands down, the men of israel began to lose the fight.
after some time, moses’ arms became tired.
so they put a large rock under moses for him to sit on.
then aaron and hur held moses’ hands in the air.
aaron was on one side of moses and hur was on the other side.
they held his hands up like this until the sun went down.
so joshua and his men defeated the amalekites in this battle.
then the lord said to moses, “write about this battle.
write these things in a book so that people will remember what happened here.
and be sure to tell joshua that i will completely destroy the amalekites from the earth.” 
then moses built an altar and named it, “the lord is my flag.” 
moses said, “i lifted my hands toward the lord’s throne.
so the lord fought against the amalekites, as he always has.” 
daniel.
chapter 11.
“during the first year that darius the mede was king, i stood up to support michael in his fight against the prince of persia.
“now then, daniel, i tell you the truth: three more kings will rule in persia.
then a fourth king will come who will be much richer than all the other kings of persia before him.
he will use his riches to get power and turn everyone against the kingdom of greece.
then a very strong and powerful king will come who will rule with much power.
he will do anything he wants.
just as he comes to power, his kingdom will be broken up and scattered in all directions.
it will not be divided among his descendants.
and it will not be ruled in the same way because that kingdom will be pulled up and given to other people.
“the southern king will become strong, but then one of his commanders will defeat him.
the commander will begin to rule, and he will be very powerful.
“then after a few years, the southern king and that commander will make an agreement.
the daughter of the southern king will marry the northern king.
she will do this to bring peace, but she and the southern king will not be strong enough.
people will turn against her and against the one who brought her to that country.
and they will turn against her child and against the one who helped her.
“but someone from her family will come to take the southern king’s place.
he will attack the armies of the northern king.
he will go into that king’s strong fort.
he will fight and win.
he will take their gods and their metal idols and their expensive things made from silver and gold.
he will take those things away to egypt.
then he will not bother the northern king for a few years.
the northern king will attack the southern kingdom.
but he will lose, and then he will go back to his own country.
“the northern king’s sons will prepare for war.
they will get a large army together.
it will move through the land very quickly, like a powerful flood.
that army will fight all the way to the strong fort of the southern king.
then the southern king will become very angry and march out to fight against the northern king.
the northern king will have a large army, but he will lose the war.
the northern army will be defeated, and those soldiers will be carried away.
the southern king will be very proud, and he will kill thousands of soldiers from the northern army.
but he will not continue to be successful.
the northern king will get another army that will be larger than the first one.
after several years he will attack.
his army will be ready for war.
it will be very large and it will have many weapons.
“in those times many people will be against the southern king.
some of your own people who love to fight will rebel against the southern king.
they will not win, but they will make the vision come true.
then the northern king will come.
he will build ramps against the walls and will capture a strong city.
the southern army will not have the power to fight back.
even the best soldiers from the southern army will not be strong enough to stop the northern army.
“the northern king will do whatever he wants.
no one will be able to stop him.
he will gain power and control in the beautiful land, and he will have the power to destroy it.
the northern king will decide to use all his power to fight against the southern king, and he will make an agreement with the southern king.
the king of the north will let one of his daughters marry the southern king so that he can defeat the southern king.
but those plans will not succeed.
his plans will not help him.
“then the northern king will turn his attention to the countries along the coast of the mediterranean sea.
he will defeat many of those cities, but then a commander will put an end to the pride and rebellion of that northern king.
the commander will make the northern king ashamed.
“after that happens, the northern king will go back to the strong forts of his own country.
but he will be weak and will fall.
he will be finished.
“after the northern king, there will be a new ruler who sends out tax collectors so that he can live like a king.
but after a few years, he will be destroyed, although he will not die in battle.
“that ruler will be followed by a very cruel and hated man, who will not have the honor of being from a king’s family.
he will become a ruler by being tricky.
he will attack the kingdom when the people feel safe.
he will defeat large and powerful armies.
he will even defeat the leader with the agreement.
many nations will make agreements with that cruel and hated ruler, but he will lie and trick them.
he will gain much power, but only a few people will support him.
“when the richest countries feel safe, that cruel and hated ruler will attack them.
he will attack at just the right time and will be successful where his ancestors were not successful.
he will take things from the countries he defeated, and he will give them to his followers.
he will plan to defeat and destroy strong cities.
he will be successful—but only for a short time.
“that very cruel and hated ruler will have a very large army.
he will use that army to show his strength and courage and attack the southern king.
the southern king will get a very large and powerful army and go to war.
but the people who are against him will make secret plans, and the southern king will be defeated.
people who were supposed to be good friends of the southern king will try to destroy him.
his army will be defeated.
many of his soldiers will be killed in battle.
those two kings will want to make trouble.
they will sit around the table planning their lies, but it will not do either one of them any good because god has set a time for their end to come.
“the northern king will go back to his own country with much wealth.
then he will decide to do bad things against the holy agreement.
he will do the things he planned, and then he will go back to his own country.
“at the right time, the northern king will attack the southern king again.
but this time he will not be successful as he was before.
ships from cyprus will come and fight against the northern king.
he will see those ships coming and be afraid.
then he will turn back and take out his anger on the holy agreement.
he will turn back and help those who stopped following the holy agreement.
the northern king will send his army to do terrible things to the temple in jerusalem.
they will stop the people from offering the daily sacrifice.
then they will do something really terrible.
they will set up that terrible thing that causes destruction.
“the northern king will use lies and smooth talking to trick those who quit following the holy agreement, so they will sin even worse.
but those who know god and obey him will be strong.
they will fight back.
“those wise teachers will help the other people understand what is happening.
but even they will have to suffer persecution.
some of them will be killed with swords.
some of them will be burned or taken prisoner.
some of them will have their homes and things taken away.
when those wise people are punished, they will receive some help, but many people who join them will be hypocrites.
some of the wise people will stumble and make mistakes.
but the persecution must come so that they can be made stronger and purer until the time of the end.
then, at the right time, that time of the end will come.
“the northern king will do whatever he wants.
he will brag about himself.
he will praise himself and think that he is even better than a god.
he will say things that no one has ever heard.
he will say those things against the god of gods.
he will be successful until all the evil things have happened.
then what god has planned to happen will happen.
“that northern king will not care about the gods his ancestors worshiped.
he will not care about the gods women worship.
he will not care about any god.
instead, he will praise himself and make himself more important than any god.
the northern king will not worship any god, but he will worship power.
power and strength will be his god.
his ancestors didn’t love power as he does.
he will honor the god of power with gold and silver, expensive jewels, and gifts.
“that northern king will attack strong fortresses with the help of this foreign god.
he will give much honor to the foreign rulers who join him.
he will put many people under their rule.
he will make the rulers pay him for the land they rule over.
“at the time of the end, the southern king will fight a battle against the northern king.
the northern king will attack him with chariots and soldiers on horses and many large ships.
the northern king will rush through the land like a flood.
the northern king will attack the beautiful land.
he will defeat many countries.
but edom, moab, and the leaders of ammon will be saved from him.
the northern king will show his power in many countries.
egypt will also learn how powerful he is.
he will get treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of egypt.
the libyans and ethiopians will obey him.
but that northern king will hear news from the east and the north that will make him afraid and angry.
he will go to completely destroy many nations.
he will set up his king’s tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain.
but finally, that bad king will die.
there will be no one to help him when his end comes.
chapter 5.
“job, call out if you want, and see if anyone answers!
but to which of the angels will you turn?
a fool’s anger will kill him.
his jealousy will destroy him.
i saw a fool who thought he was safe, but suddenly he died.
there was no one to help his children.
no one defended them in court.
hungry people ate all his crops, even the grain growing among the thorns, and greedy people took all he had.
bad times don’t come up from the dirt.
trouble does not grow from the ground.
but people are born to have trouble, as surely as sparks rise from a fire.
if i were you, i would turn to god and tell him about my problems.
people cannot understand the wonderful things god does.
his miracles are too many to count.
he sends rain all over the earth and waters the fields.
he raises up the humble and makes sad people happy.
he spoils the plans of even the smartest people so that they will not succeed.
he catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps and brings to an end their evil plans.
daylight will be like darkness for them.
even at noon they will have to feel their way as in the dark.
god saves the poor from the hurtful words of the wicked.
he saves them from those who are powerful.
so the poor have hope; god shuts the mouths of those who would cause them harm.
“you are fortunate when god corrects you.
so don’t complain when god all-powerful punishes you.
god might injure you, but he will bandage those wounds.
he might hurt you, but his hands also heal.
he will save you again and again.
no evil will harm you.
god will save you from death when there is famine.
he will protect you from the sword when there is war.
people might say bad things about you with their sharp tongues.
but god will protect you.
you will not be afraid when bad things happen!
you will laugh at destruction and famine.
you will not be afraid of wild animals!
it is as if you have a peace treaty with the wild animals and the rocks in the field.
you will live in peace because your tent is safe.
you will count your property and find nothing missing.
you will have many children.
they will be as many as the blades of grass on the earth.
you will be like the wheat that grows until harvest time.
yes, you will live to a ripe old age.
“we have studied this and know it is true.
so listen to us, and learn for yourself.” 
leviticus.
chapter 26.
“don’t make idols for yourselves.
don’t set up statues or memorial stones in your land to bow down to, because i am the lord your god!
“remember my special days of rest and honor my holy place.
i am the lord.
“remember my laws and commands, and obey them.
if you do these things, i will give you rains at the time they should come.
the land will grow crops and the trees of the field will grow their fruit.
your threshing will continue until it is time to gather grapes.
and your grape gathering will continue until it is time to plant.
then you will have plenty to eat.
and you will live safely in your land.
i will give peace to your country.
you will lie down in peace.
no one will come to make you afraid.
i will keep harmful animals out of your country.
and armies will not come through your country.
“you will chase your enemies and defeat them.
you will kill them with your swords.
five of you will chase 100 men, and 100 of you will chase 10,000 men.
you will defeat your enemies and kill them with your sword.
“then i will turn to you.
i will let you have many children.
i will keep my agreement with you.
you will have enough crops to last for more than a year.
you will harvest the new crops.
but then you will have to throw out the old crops to make room for the new crops.
also, i will place my holy tent among you.
i will not turn away from you.
i will walk with you and be your god.
and you will be my people.
i am the lord your god.
you were slaves in egypt, but i brought you out of egypt.
you were bent low from the heavy weights you carried as slaves, but i broke the poles that were on your shoulders.
i let you walk proudly again.
“but if you don’t obey me and all my commands, bad things will happen to you.
if you refuse to obey my laws and commands, you have broken my agreement.
if you do that, i will cause terrible things to happen to you.
i will cause you to have disease and fever.
they will destroy your eyes and take away your life.
you will not have success when you plant your seed.
and your enemies will eat your crops.
i will be against you, so your enemies will defeat you.
these enemies will hate you and rule over you.
you will run away even when no one is chasing you.
“after these things, if you still don’t obey me, i will punish you seven times more for your sins.
and i will also destroy the great cities that make you proud.
the skies will not give rain, and the earth will not produce crops.
you will work hard, but it will not help.
your land will not give any crops, and your trees will not grow their fruit.
“if you still turn against me and refuse to obey me, i will beat you seven times harder!
the more you sin, the more you will be punished.
i will send wild animals against you.
they will take your children away from you.
they will destroy your animals.
they will kill many of your people.
the roads will all be empty.
“if you don’t learn your lesson after all this, and if you still turn against me, 
then i will also turn against you.
i—yes, i myself—will punish you seven times for your sins.
you will have broken my agreement, so i will punish you.
i will bring armies against you.
you will go into your cities for safety, but i will cause diseases to spread among you.
and your enemies will defeat you.
i will give you a share of the grain left in that city.
but there will be very little food to eat.
ten women will be able to cook all their bread in one oven.
they will measure each piece of bread.
you will eat, but you will still be hungry.
“if you still refuse to listen to me, and if you still turn against me, 
then i will really show my anger!
i—yes, i myself—will punish you seven times for your sins.
you will become so hungry that you will eat the bodies of your sons and daughters.
i will destroy your high places.
i will cut down your incense altars.
i will put your dead bodies on the dead bodies of your idols.
you will be disgusting to me.
i will destroy your cities.
i will make your holy places empty.
i will stop smelling your offerings.
i will make your land empty.
and your enemies who come to live there will be shocked at it.
i will scatter you among the nations.
i will pull out my sword and destroy you.
your land will become empty, and your cities will be destroyed.
“you will be taken to your enemy’s country.
your country will be empty.
so your land will finally get its rest.
the land will enjoy its time of rest.
during the time that the land is empty, it will get the time of rest that you did not give it while you lived there.
the survivors will lose their courage in the land of their enemies.
they will be afraid of everything.
they will run around like a leaf blown by the wind.
they will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword.
they will fall even when no one is chasing them.
they will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword.
they will fall over each other—even when no one is chasing them.
“you will not be strong enough to stand up against your enemies.
you will be lost in other nations.
you will disappear in the land of your enemies.
so the survivors will rot away in their sin in their enemies’ countries.
they will rot away in their sins just as their ancestors did.
“but maybe the people will confess their sins.
and maybe they will confess the sins of their ancestors.
maybe they will admit that they turned against me.
maybe they will admit that they sinned against me.
maybe they will admit that i turned against them and brought them into the land of their enemies.
these people will be like strangers to me.
but maybe they will become humble and accept the punishment for their sin.
if they do, i will remember my agreement with jacob.
i will remember my agreement with isaac.
i will remember my agreement with abraham, and i will remember the land.
“the land will be empty.
the land will enjoy its time of rest.
then the survivors will accept the punishment for their sins.
they will learn that they were punished because they hated my laws and refused to obey my rules.
they have sinned.
but if they come to me for help, i will not turn away from them.
i will listen to them, even if they are in the land of their enemies.
i will not completely destroy them.
i will not break my agreement with them, because i am the lord their god.
for them, i will remember the agreement with their ancestors.
i brought their ancestors out of the land of egypt so that i could become their god.
the other nations saw these things.
i am the lord.” 
these are the laws, rules, and teachings that the lord gave to the israelites.
these laws are the agreement between the lord and the israelites.
the lord gave these laws to moses at mount sinai.
chapter 22.
this is a message about the valley of vision: jerusalem, what is wrong?
why has everyone gone up to hide in their upper rooms?
this city was so happy, but now there is a terrible uproar.
there are bodies lying everywhere, but they were not killed with swords.
the people died, but not while fighting.
all your officers ran away together, but they have all been captured without bows.
all the leaders ran away together, but they were found and captured.
so i say, “don’t look at me!
let me cry!
don’t rush to comfort me about the destruction of jerusalem.” 
the lord god all-powerful chose a special day for there to be riots and confusion.
people trampled on each other in the valley of vision.
the city walls were pulled down.
people in the valley shouted up at those on the mountain.
horse soldiers from elam took their bags of arrows and rode into battle.
soldiers from kir rattled their shields.
your favorite valley was filled with chariots.
horse soldiers were stationed in front of the city gates.
then the cover protecting judah was removed, and the people turned to the weapons they kept at the forest palace.
then you noticed how many cracks there were in the walls around the city of david, so you began collecting water from the lower pool.
you counted the houses and used stones from them to repair the walls.
then you built a pool between the double walls for storing water from the old pool.
you did all this to protect yourselves, but you did not trust the god who made all these things.
you did not even notice the one who made all these things so long ago.
so the lord god all-powerful told the people to cry and mourn for their dead friends.
he told them to shave their heads and wear mourning clothes.
but look, everyone was happy.
the people rejoiced, saying, “kill the cattle and sheep, and let’s celebrate.
let’s eat meat and drink wine.
eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” 
the lord all-powerful said this to me and i heard it with my own ears: “you are guilty of doing wrong, and i promise that you will die before this guilt is forgiven.” the lord god all-powerful said these things.
the lord god all-powerful told me to go to shebna, the palace manager, 
and say this: “what are you doing here?
none of your relatives are buried here, are they?
then what right do you have to prepare a tomb for yourself in this high place?
why are you cutting a tomb out of this rock?
“what a big man you are!
but the lord will crush you.
he will roll you into a small ball and throw you far away into the open arms of another country, and there you will die.
“you are very proud of your chariots.
but in that faraway land, your new ruler will have better chariots.
and your chariots will not look important in his palace.
i will force you out of your position here.
your new leader will take you away from your important job.
at that time i will call for my servant eliakim son of hilkiah.
i will take your robe and put it on him.
i will give him your scepter.
i will give him the important job you have, and he will be like a father to the people of jerusalem and judah’s family.
“i will put the key to david’s house around his neck.
if he opens a door, no one will be able to close it.
if he closes a door, no one will be able to open it.
he will be like a favorite chair in his father’s house.
i will make him like a strong peg in a solid board.
all the honored and important things of his father’s house will hang on him.
all the adults and little children will depend on him.
they will be like little dishes and big water bottles hanging on him.” 
the lord all-powerful said, “at that time the peg that is now in the solid board will get weak and break.
it will fall to the ground, and everything hanging on it will be destroyed.
then everything i said in this message will happen.
it will happen because the lord said it would.” 
1 samuel.
chapter 5.
the philistines carried god’s holy box, from ebenezer to ashdod.
they carried god’s holy box into the temple of dagon and put it next to the statue of dagon.
the next morning, the people of ashdod got up and found dagon lying face down on the ground before the lord’s box.
the people of ashdod put the statue of dagon back in its place.
but the next morning when the people of ashdod got up, they found dagon on the ground again.
dagon had fallen down before the lord’s holy box.
this time, dagon’s head and hands were broken off and were lying in the doorway.
only his body was still in one piece.
that is why, even today, the priests or other people refuse to step on the threshold when they enter dagon’s temple at ashdod.
the lord made life hard for the people of ashdod and their neighbors.
he gave them many troubles and caused them to get tumors.
he also sent mice to them.
the mice ran all over their ships and then onto their land.
the people in the city were very afraid.
they saw what was happening and said, “the holy box of the god of israel can’t stay here.
god is punishing us and dagon our god.” 
the people of ashdod called the five philistine rulers together and asked them, “what must we do with the holy box of the god of israel?” the rulers answered, “move the holy box of the god of israel to gath.” so the philistines moved god’s holy box.
but after the philistines had moved god’s holy box to gath, the lord punished that city.
the people became very frightened.
god caused many troubles for all the people—young and old.
he caused the people in gath to have tumors.
so the philistines sent god’s holy box to ekron.
but when god’s holy box came into ekron, the people of ekron complained.
they said, “why are you bringing the box of the god of israel to our city ekron?
do you want to kill us and our people?” 
the people of ekron called all the philistine rulers together and said to the rulers, “send the box of the god of israel back home before it kills us and our people!” the people of ekron were deathly afraid because god severely punished them there.
many people died, and those who did not, had tumors.
the people of ekron cried loudly to heaven.
chapter 13.
the lord said to moses, 
“send some men to explore the land of canaan.
i will give this land to the israelites.
send one leader from each of the twelve tribes.” 
so moses obeyed the lord’s command and sent out the israelite leaders while the people were camped in the desert of paran.
these are their names: from the tribe of reuben—shammua son of zaccur; 
from the tribe of simeon—shaphat son of hori; 
from the tribe of judah—caleb son of jephunneh; 
from the tribe of issachar—igal son of joseph; 
from the tribe of ephraim—hoshea son of nun; 
from the tribe of benjamin—palti son of raphu; 
from the tribe of zebulun—gaddiel son of sodi; 
from the tribe of manasseh (a tribe from joseph)—gaddi son of susi; 
from the tribe of dan—ammiel son of gemalli; 
from the tribe of asher—sethur son of michael; 
from the tribe of naphtali—nahbi son of vophsi; 
from the tribe of gad—geuel son of maki.
these are the names of the men moses sent to look at and study the land.
(moses called hoshea son of nun by another name.
moses called him joshua.)
when moses was sending them out to explore canaan, he said, “go through the negev and then into the hill country.
see what the land looks like.
learn about the people who live there.
are they strong or are they weak?
are they few or are they many?
learn about the land that they live in.
is it good land or bad land?
what kind of towns do they live in?
do the towns have walls protecting them?
are the towns strongly defended?
and learn other things about the land.
is the soil good for growing things, or is it poor soil?
are there trees on the land?
try to bring back some of the fruit from that land.” (this was during the time when the first grapes should be ripe.)
so they went to explore the country.
they explored the area from the desert of zin to rehob and lebo hamath.
they entered the country through the negev and went to hebron.
(the town of hebron was built seven years before the town of zoan in egypt.)
ahiman, sheshai, and talmai lived there.
these men were descendants of anak.
then the men went to eshcol valley.
there they cut off a branch from a grapevine that had a bunch of grapes on it.
they put that branch on a pole, and two men carried it between them.
they also carried some pomegranates and figs.
that place is called the eshcol valley, because there the men of israel cut off the bunch of grapes.
the men explored that country for 40 days, and then they went back to the camp.
the israelites were camped near kadesh, in the desert of paran.
the men went to moses and aaron and all the israelites.
they told moses, aaron, and all the people what they saw and showed them the fruit from the land.
the men told moses, “we went to the land where you sent us.
it is a land filled with many good things!
here is some of the fruit that grows there.
but the people living there are very powerful.
the cities are very large and strongly defended.
we even saw some anakites there.
the amalekites live in the negev.
the hittites, jebusites, and amorites live in the hill country.
the canaanites live near the sea and by the jordan river.” 
caleb told the people near moses to be quiet.
then caleb said, “we should go up and take that land for ourselves.
we can easily take that land.” 
but the men who had gone with him said, “we cannot fight those people!
they are much stronger than we are.” 
so those men gave a report that discouraged the people.
they said, “the land we saw is full of strong people.
they are strong enough to easily defeat anyone who goes there.
we saw the giant nephilim people there!
(the descendants of anak come from the nephilim.)
we felt like little grasshoppers.
yes, we were like grasshoppers to them!” 
ecclesiastes.
chapter 2.
i said to myself, “i should have fun—i should enjoy everything as much as i can.” but i learned that this is also useless.
it is foolish to laugh all the time.
having fun does not do any good.
so i decided to fill my body with wine while i filled my mind with wisdom.
i tried this foolishness because i wanted to find a way to be happy.
i wanted to see what was good for people to do during their few days of life.
then i began doing great things.
i built houses, and i planted vineyards for myself.
i planted gardens, and i made parks.
i planted all kinds of fruit trees.
i made pools of water for myself, and i used them to water my growing trees.
i bought men and women slaves, and there were slaves born in my house.
i owned many great things.
i had herds of cattle and flocks of sheep.
i owned more things than any other person in jerusalem did.
i also gathered silver and gold for myself.
i took treasures from kings and their nations.
i had men and women singing for me.
i had everything any man could want.
i became very rich and famous.
i was greater than anyone who lived in jerusalem before me.
my wisdom was always there to help me.
anything my eyes saw and wanted, i got for myself.
my mind was pleased with everything i did.
and this happiness was the reward for all my hard work.
but then i looked at everything i had done and the wealth i had gained.
i decided it was all a waste of time!
it was like trying to catch the wind.
there is nothing to gain from anything we do in this life.
then i decided to think about what it means to be wise or to be foolish or to do crazy things.
and i thought about the one who will be the next king.
the new king will do the same as the kings before him.
i saw that wisdom is better than foolishness in the same way that light is better than darkness.
wise people use their minds like eyes to see where they are going.
but for fools, it is as if they are walking in the dark.
i also saw that fools and wise people both end the same way.
i thought to myself, “the same thing that happens to a fool will also happen to me.
so why have i tried so hard to become wise?” i said to myself, “being wise is also useless.” 
whether people are wise or foolish, they will still die, and no one will remember either one of them forever.
in the future, people will forget everything both of them did.
so the two are really the same.
this made me hate life.
it was depressing to think that everything in this life is useless, like trying to catch the wind.
i began to hate all the hard work i had done, because i saw that the people who live after me would get the things that i worked for.
i will not be able to take them with me.
some other person will control everything i worked and studied for.
and i don’t know if that person will be wise or foolish.
this is also senseless.
so i became sad about all the work i had done.
people can work hard using all their wisdom and knowledge and skill.
but they will die and other people will get the things they worked for.
they did not do the work, but they will get everything.
that makes me very sad.
it is also not fair and is senseless.
what do people really have after all their work and struggling in this life?
throughout their life, they have pain, frustrations, and hard work.
even at night, a person’s mind does not rest.
this is also senseless.
there is no one who has tried to enjoy life more than i have.
and this is what i learned: the best thing people can do is eat, drink, and enjoy the work they must do.
i also saw that this comes from god.
if people do good and please god, he will give them wisdom, knowledge, and joy.
but those who sin will get only the work of gathering and carrying things.
god takes from the bad person and gives to the good person.
but all this work is useless.
it is like trying to catch the wind.
2 kings.
chapter 21.
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to rule.
he ruled 55 years in jerusalem.
his mother’s name was hephzibah.
manasseh did what the lord said was wrong.
he did the terrible things the other nations did.
(and the lord forced those nations to leave their country when the israelites came.)
manasseh rebuilt the high places that his father hezekiah had destroyed.
he also built altars for baal and made an asherah pole, just as king ahab of israel had done.
manasseh worshiped and served the stars of heaven.
he built altars to honor false gods in the lord’s temple.
(this is the place the lord was talking about when he said, “i will put my name in jerusalem.”) 
manasseh built altars for the stars of heaven in the two courtyards of the lord’s temple.
he sacrificed his own son and burned him on the altar.
he used different ways of trying to know the future.
he visited mediums and wizards.
manasseh did more and more things that the lord saw as evil, which made the lord angry.
manasseh made a carved statue of asherah.
he put this statue in the temple.
the lord had said to david and to david’s son solomon about this temple: “i have chosen jerusalem from all the cities in israel.
i will put my name in the temple in jerusalem forever.
i will not cause the israelites to leave the land that i gave to their ancestors.
i will let the people stay in their land if they obey everything i commanded them and all the teachings that my servant moses gave them.” 
but the people did not listen to god.
manasseh did more evil things than all the nations that lived in canaan before israel came.
and the lord destroyed those nations when the israelites came to take their land.
the lord used his servants the prophets to say this: 
“king manasseh of judah has done these hated things and has done more evil than the amorites before him.
he also has caused judah to sin because of his idols.
so the lord, the god of israel, says, ‘look!
i will bring so much trouble against jerusalem and judah that anyone who hears about it will be shocked.
i will stretch the measuring line of samaria and the plumb line of ahab’s family over jerusalem.
a man wipes a dish, and then he turns it upside down.
i will do that to jerusalem.
there will still be a few of my people left, but i will leave them.
i will give them to their enemies.
their enemies will take them as prisoners—they will be like the valuable things soldiers take in war.
this is because my people did what i said was wrong.
they have made me angry with them since the day their ancestors came up out of egypt.
and manasseh killed many innocent people.
he filled jerusalem from one end to another with blood.
and all these sins are in addition to the sins that caused judah to sin.
manasseh caused judah to do what the lord said was wrong.’” 
all the things that manasseh did, including the sins that he committed, are written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
manasseh died and was buried with his ancestors.
he was buried in the garden at his house.
it was called the “garden of uzza.” his son amon became the new king after him.
amon was 22 years old when he began to rule.
he ruled two years in jerusalem.
his mother’s name was meshullemeth daughter of haruz from jotbah.
amon did what the lord said was wrong, just as his father manasseh had done.
amon lived just as his father had lived.
he worshiped and served the same idols his father had worshiped.
amon left the lord, the god of his ancestors, and did not live the way the lord wanted.
amon’s servants made plans against him and killed him in his palace.
the common people killed all the officers who made plans against king amon.
then the people made amon’s son josiah the new king after him.
the other things that amon did are written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
amon was buried in his grave at the garden of uzza.
his son josiah became the new king.
chapter 7.
a good reputation is better than expensive pleasures.
the day someone dies is better than the day they were born.
it is better to go to a funeral than to a party, because everyone must die, and the living need to remember this.
sorrow is even better than laughter, because when our face is sad, our heart becomes good.
a wise person thinks about death, but a fool thinks only about having a good time.
it is better to be criticized by the wise than praised by the foolish.
the laughter of fools is such a waste.
it is like thorns burning under a pot.
the thorns burn so quickly that the pot does not get hot.
even the wise will forget their wisdom, if someone pays them enough.
that money destroys their understanding.
it is better to finish something than to start it.
it is better to be gentle and patient than to be proud and impatient.
don’t become angry quickly, because anger is foolish.
don’t say, “life was better in the ‘good old days.’ what happened?” wisdom does not lead us to ask that question.
wisdom is better if you also have property.
wise people will get more than enough wealth.
wisdom and money can protect you.
but knowledge gained through wisdom is even better—it can save your life.
look at what god has made.
you cannot change a thing, even if you think it is wrong.
when life is good, enjoy it.
but when life is hard, remember that god gives us good times and hard times.
and no one knows what will happen in the future.
in my short life, i have seen everything.
i have seen good people die young, and i have seen evil people live long lives.
so why ruin your life?
don’t be too good or too bad, and don’t be too wise or too foolish.
why should you die before your time?
try to be a little of this and a little of that.
even god’s followers will do some good things and some bad things.
surely there is no one on earth who always does good and never sins.
but wisdom can make one person stronger than ten leaders in a city.
don’t listen to everything people say.
you might hear your own servant saying bad things about you.
and you know that many times you too have said bad things about other people.
i used my wisdom and thought about all these things.
i wanted to be wise, but i couldn’t do it.
i cannot understand why things are as they are.
it is too hard for anyone to understand.
i studied and i tried very hard to find true wisdom.
i tried to find a reason for everything.
i did learn that it is foolish to be evil, and it is crazy to act like a fool.
i also found that some women are dangerous like traps.
their hearts are like nets, and their arms are like chains.
it is worse than death to be caught by these women.
god’s followers should run away from them.
let the sinners be caught by them.
the teacher says, “i added all this together to see what answer i could find.
i am still looking for answers, but i did find this: i found one good man in a thousand.
but i did not find even one good woman.
“there is one other thing i have learned.
god made people good, but they have found many ways to be bad.” 
psalm.
chapter 115.
lord, you should receive the honor, not us.
the honor belongs to you because of your faithful love and loyalty.
why should the nations wonder where our god is?
our god is in heaven, and he does whatever he wants.
the “gods” of those nations are only statues that some human made from gold and silver.
those statues have mouths, but cannot talk.
they have eyes, but cannot see.
they have ears, but cannot hear.
they have noses, but cannot smell.
they have hands, but cannot feel.
they have feet, but cannot walk.
no sounds come from their throats.
the people who make and trust in those statues will become like them!
people of israel, trust in the lord!
he is your strength and shield.
aaron’s family, trust in the lord!
he is your strength and shield.
followers of the lord, trust in the lord!
he is your strength and shield.
the lord remembers us.
he will bless us.
he will bless israel.
he will bless aaron’s family.
the lord will bless his followers, great and small.
may the lord give more and more to you and to your children.
may you receive blessings from the lord, who made heaven and earth.
heaven belongs to the lord, but he gave the earth to people.
the dead don’t praise him.
those in the grave don’t praise the lord.
but we will praise the lord now and forever!
praise the lord!
chapter 38.
about that time, judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named hirah from the town of adullam.
judah met a canaanite girl there and married her.
the girl’s father was named shua.
the canaanite girl gave birth to a son and named him er.
later, she gave birth to another son and named him onan.
then she had another son named shelah.
judah lived in kezib when his third son was born.
judah chose a woman named tamar to be the wife of his first son er.
but er did many bad things.
the lord was not happy with him, so the lord killed him.
then judah said to er’s brother onan, “go and sleep with your dead brother’s wife.
become like a husband to her.
if children are born, they will belong to your brother er.” 
onan knew that the children from this union would not belong to him.
he had sexual relations with tamar, but he did not allow himself to stay inside her.
this made the lord angry.
so he killed onan also.
then judah said to his daughter-in-law tamar, “go back to your father’s house.
stay there and don’t marry until my young son shelah grows up.” judah was afraid that shelah would also be killed like his brothers.
so tamar went back to her father’s home.
later, judah’s wife, the daughter of shua, died.
after judah’s time of sadness, he went to timnah with his friend hirah from adullam.
judah went to timnah to have the wool cut from his sheep.
tamar learned that judah, her father-in-law, was going to timnah to cut the wool from his sheep.
tamar always wore clothes that showed that she was a widow.
so she put on some different clothes and covered her face with a veil.
then she sat down near the road going to enaim, a town near timnah.
tamar knew that judah’s younger son shelah was now grown up, but judah would not make plans for her to marry him.
judah traveled on that road and saw her, but he thought that she was a prostitute.
(her face was covered with a veil like a prostitute.)
so he went to her and said, “let me have sex with you.” (judah did not know that she was tamar, his daughter-in-law.)
she said, “how much will you give me?” 
judah answered, “i will send you a young goat from my flock.” she answered, “i agree to that.
but first you must give me something to keep until you send me the goat.” 
judah asked, “what do you want me to give you as proof that i will send you the goat?” tamar answered, “give me your seal and its string and your walking stick.” judah gave these things to her.
then judah and tamar had sexual relations, and she became pregnant.
then tamar went home, took off her veil that covered her face, and again put on the special clothes that showed she was a widow.
later, judah sent his friend hirah to enaim to give the prostitute the goat he promised.
judah also told hirah to get the special seal and the walking stick from her, but hirah could not find her.
he asked some of the men at the town of enaim, “where is the prostitute who was here by the road?” the men answered, “there has never been a prostitute here.” 
so judah’s friend went back to judah and said, “i could not find the woman.
the men who live in that place said that there was never a prostitute there.” 
so judah said, “let her keep the things.
i don’t want people to laugh at us.
i tried to give her the goat, but we could not find her.
that is enough.” 
about three months later, someone told judah, “your daughter-in-law tamar sinned like a prostitute, and now she is pregnant.” then judah said, “take her out and burn her.” 
the men went to tamar to kill her, but she sent a message to her father-in-law that said, “the man who made me pregnant is the man who owns these things.
look at them.
whose are they?
whose special seal and string is this?
whose walking stick is this?” 
judah recognized these things and said, “she is right.
i was wrong.
i did not give her my son shelah like i promised.” and judah did not sleep with her again.
the time came for tamar to give birth.
she was going to have twins.
while she was giving birth, one baby put his hand out.
the nurse tied a red string on the hand and said, “this baby was born first.” 
but that baby pulled his hand back in, so the other baby was born first.
so the nurse said, “you were able to break out first!” so they named him perez.
after this, the other baby was born.
this was the baby with the red string on his hand.
they named him zerah.

chapter 21.
satan was against the israelites.
he encouraged david to count the israelites.
so david said to joab and the leaders of the people, “go and count all the israelites.
count everyone in the country—from the town of beersheba all the way to the town of dan.
then tell me, so i will know how many people there are.” 
but joab answered, “may the lord make his nation 100 times as large!
sir, all the israelites are your servants.
why do you want to do this thing, my lord and king?
you will make all the israelites guilty of sin!” 
but king david was stubborn.
joab had to do what the king said.
so joab left and went through all the country of israel counting the people.
then he came back to jerusalem 
and told david how many people there were.
in israel there were 1,100,000 men who could use a sword.
and there were 470,000 men in judah who could use a sword.
joab did not count the tribes of levi and benjamin because he did not like king david’s order.
david had done a bad thing in god’s sight, so god punished israel.
then david said to god, “i have done something very foolish.
i have committed a terrible sin by counting the israelites.
now, i beg you to take the sin away from me, your servant.” 
gad was david’s seer.
the lord said to gad, “go and tell david: ‘this is what the lord says: i am going to give you three choices.
you must choose one of them.
then i will punish you the way you choose.’” 
then gad went to david.
he said to david, “the lord says, ‘david, choose which punishment you want: three years without enough food, or three months of running away from your enemies while they use their swords to chase you, or three days of punishment from the lord.
terrible sicknesses will spread through the country, and the lord’s angel will go through israel destroying the people.’ david, god sent me.
now, you must decide which answer i will give to him.” 
david said to gad, “i am in trouble!
i don’t want some man to decide my punishment.
the lord is very merciful, so let him decide how to punish me.” 
so the lord sent terrible sicknesses to israel, and 70,000 people died.
god sent an angel to destroy jerusalem.
but when the angel started to destroy jerusalem, the lord saw it and felt sorry for all the suffering.
so he said to the angel who was destroying the people, “stop!
that is enough!” this happened when the angel of the lord was standing at the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite.
david looked up and saw the lord’s angel in the sky.
the angel was holding his sword over the city of jerusalem.
then david and the elders bowed with their faces touching the ground.
they were wearing the special clothes to show their sadness.
david said to god, “i am the one who sinned.
i gave the order for the people to be counted!
i was wrong.
the israelites did not do anything wrong.
lord my god, punish me and my family, but stop the terrible sicknesses that are killing your people.” 
then the angel of the lord spoke to gad.
he said, “tell david to build an altar to worship the lord.
david must build that altar near the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite.” 
gad told david this, and david went to araunah’s threshing floor.
araunah was threshing the wheat.
he turned around and saw the angel.
his four sons ran away to hide.
david walked up the hill to araunah.
araunah saw him and left the threshing floor.
he walked to david and bowed with his face to the ground in front of him.
david said to araunah, “sell me your threshing floor.
i will pay you the full price.
then i can use the area to build an altar to worship the lord.
then the terrible sicknesses will be stopped.” 
araunah said to david, “take this threshing floor.
you are my lord and king, so do whatever you want.
look, i will also give you cattle for the burnt offering.
you can have the wooden threshing tools to burn for the fire on the altar.
and i will give the wheat for the grain offering.
i will give all this to you.” 
but king david answered araunah, “no, i will pay you the full price.
i will not take anything that is yours and give it to the lord.
i will not give offerings that cost me nothing.” 
so david gave araunah about 15 pounds of gold for the place.
david built an altar for worshiping the lord there.
david offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
he prayed to the lord.
the lord answered david by sending fire down from heaven.
the fire came down on the altar of burnt offering.
then the lord commanded the angel to put his sword back into its sheath.
david saw that the lord had answered him on the threshing floor of araunah, so david offered sacrifices there.
(the lord’s holy tent and the altar of burnt offerings were at the high place in the town of gibeon.
moses had made the holy tent while the israelites were in the desert.
david could not go to the holy tent to speak with god because he was afraid.
he was afraid of the angel of the lord and his sword.)
chapter 3.
then i said, “listen, leaders of jacob and officers of the nation of israel!
you should know what justice is.
but you hate good and love evil.
you tear the skin off the people and tear the flesh off their bones.
you are destroying my people.
you take their skin off them and break their bones.
you chop their bones up like meat to put in the pot!
then you will pray to the lord, but he will not answer you.
no, he will hide his face from you, because what you do is evil.” 
some false prophets are telling lies to the lord’s people.
this is what the lord says about them: “these prophets are led by their stomachs.
they promise peace for those who give them food, but they promise war to those who do not give them food.
“this is why it is like night for you and you don’t have visions.
you cannot see what will happen in the future, so it is like darkness to you.
the sun has gone down on the prophets.
they cannot see what will happen in the future, so it is like darkness to them.
the seers are ashamed.
the fortunetellers are embarrassed.
none of them will say anything, because god will not speak to them.” 
but the lord’s spirit has filled me with power, goodness, and strength.
so i can tell jacob about his crimes, and so i can tell israel about his sins!
leaders of jacob and rulers of israel, listen to me!
you hate the right way of living!
if something is straight, then you make it crooked!
you build zion by murdering people.
you build jerusalem by cheating people!
the judges in jerusalem accept bribes to help them decide who wins in court.
the priests in jerusalem must be paid before they will teach the people.
people must pay the prophets before they will look into the future.
then those leaders expect the lord to help them.
they say, “the lord lives here with us, so nothing bad will happen to us.” 
leaders, because of you, zion will be destroyed.
it will become a plowed field.
jerusalem will become a pile of rocks.
temple mount will be an empty hill overgrown with bushes.
chapter 19.
the lord said to me, “jeremiah, go and buy a clay jar from a potter.
take some of the elders of the people and some priests with you.
go out to the valley of ben hinnom, near the front of the potsherd gate.
i have a message i want you to announce there.
say to those who are with you, ‘king of judah and people of jerusalem, listen to this message from the lord!
this is what the lord all-powerful, the god of the people of israel, says: i will soon make a terrible thing happen to this place!
everyone who hears about it will be amazed and full of fear.
i will do these things because the people of judah have stopped following me.
they have made this a place for foreign gods.
the people of judah have burned sacrifices in this place to other gods.
the people long ago did not worship those gods.
their ancestors did not worship them.
these are new gods from other countries.
the kings of judah filled this place with the blood of innocent children.
the kings of judah built high places for the god baal.
they use those places to burn their sons in the fire.
they burned their sons as burnt offerings to the god baal.
i did not tell them to do that.
i did not ask them to offer their sons as sacrifices.
i never even thought of such a thing.
now people call this place topheth and the valley of hinnom.
but i give you this warning.
this message is from the lord: the days are coming, when people will call this place the valley of slaughter.
at this place, i will ruin the plans of the people of judah and jerusalem.
the enemy will chase them, and i will let the people of judah be killed with swords in this place.
i will make their dead bodies food for the birds and wild animals.
i will completely destroy this city.
people will whistle and shake their heads when they pass by jerusalem.
they will be shocked when they see how the city was destroyed.
the enemy will bring its army around the city.
that army will not let people go out to get food, so the people in the city will begin to starve.
they will become so hungry that they will eat the bodies of their own sons and daughters, and then they will begin to eat each other.’ 
“jeremiah, tell this to the people, and while they are watching, break the jar.
then say this: ‘the lord all-powerful says, i will break the nation of judah and the city of jerusalem, just as someone breaks a clay jar!
and like a broken jar, the nation of judah cannot be put together again.
it will be the same for the nation of judah.
the dead people will be buried here in topheth until there is no more room.
i will do this to these people and to this place.
i will make this city like topheth.’ this message is from the lord.
‘the houses in jerusalem will become as “dirty” as this place, topheth.
the kings’ palaces will be ruined like this place, topheth, because the people worshiped false gods on the roofs of their houses.
they worshiped the stars and burned sacrifices to honor them.
they gave drink offerings to false gods.’” 
then jeremiah left topheth where the lord had told him to speak.
jeremiah went to the lord’s temple and stood in the courtyard of the temple.
jeremiah said to all the people: 
“this is what the lord all-powerful, the god of israel says: ‘i said i would bring many disasters to jerusalem and the villages around it.
i will soon make this happen because the people are very stubborn.
they refuse to listen and obey me.’” 
psalm.
chapter 89.
a maskil from ethan the ezrahite.
i will sing forever about the lord’s love.
i will sing about his faithfulness forever and ever!
i will say, “your faithful love will last forever.
your loyalty is like the sky—there is no end to it!” 
you said, “i made an agreement with my chosen king.
i made this promise to my servant david: 
‘there will always be someone from your family to rule.
i will make your kingdom continue forever and ever.’” selah 
lord, the heavens praise you for the amazing things you do.
the assembly of holy ones sings about your loyalty.
no one in heaven is equal to the lord.
none of the “gods” can compare to the lord.
when god’s holy ones—the angels around his throne—meet together, they fear and respect him; he is more awesome than all those around him.
lord god all-powerful, there is no one like you.
you are strong, lord, and always faithful.
you rule the stormy sea.
you can calm its angry waves.
you defeated rahab.
you scattered your enemies with your own powerful arm.
everything in heaven and earth belongs to you.
you made the world and everything in it.
you created everything north and south.
mount tabor and mount hermon sing praises to your name.
you have the power!
your power is great!
victory is yours!
your kingdom is built on truth and justice.
love and faithfulness are servants before your throne.
lord, your loyal followers are happy.
they live in the light of your kindness.
your name always makes them happy.
they praise your goodness.
you are their amazing strength.
their power comes from you.
the king, our protector, belongs to the lord, who is the holy one of israel.
lord, you once spoke in a vision to your followers: “i have made a young soldier strong.
from among my people i chose him for an important position.
i have found my servant david and anointed him as king with my special oil.
i will support him with my right hand, and my arm will make him strong.
so no enemy will ever control him.
the wicked will never defeat him.
i will destroy his enemies before his eyes.
i will defeat those who hate him.
i will always love and support him.
i will always make him strong.
i will put him in charge of the sea.
he will control the rivers.
he will say to me, ‘you are my father.
you are my god, my rock, my savior.’ 
and i will make him my firstborn son.
he will be the great king on earth.
my love will protect him forever.
my agreement with him will never end.
i will make his family continue forever.
his kingdom will last as long as the skies.
if his descendants stop following my law and stop obeying my commands, 
if they break my laws and ignore my commands, 
i will punish them severely for their sins and wrongs.
but i will never take my love from him.
i will never stop being loyal to him.
i will not break my agreement with david.
i will never change what i said.
by my holiness, i made a promise to him, and i would not lie to david.
his family will continue forever.
his kingdom will last as long as the sun.
like the moon, it will continue forever.
the sky is a witness to the agreement that can be trusted.” selah 
but now, lord, you have become angry with your chosen king, and you have left him all alone.
you ended the agreement you made with your servant.
you threw the king’s crown into the dirt.
you pulled down the walls of his city.
you destroyed all his fortresses.
everyone passing by steals from him.
his neighbors laugh at him.
you made all the king’s enemies happy and let his enemies win the war.
you helped them defend themselves.
you did not help your king win the battle.
you did not let him win.
you threw his throne to the ground.
you cut his life short.
you shamed him.
selah 
lord, how long will this continue?
will you ignore us forever?
will your anger burn like a fire forever?
remember how short my life is.
you created us to live a short life and then die.
is there anyone alive who will never die?
will anyone escape the grave?
selah 
lord, where is the love you showed in the past?
you promised david that you would be loyal to his family.
my lord, please remember how people insulted your servant.
lord, i had to listen to all the insults from your enemies.
they insulted your chosen king wherever he went.
praise the lord forever!
amen and amen!
chapter 27.
job continued his answer: 
“god all-powerful has been unfair to me; he has made my life bitter.
but i swear by his life, 
as long as i have life in me, as long as breath from god is in my nostrils, 
i will not be a hypocrite.
i will not lie.
you will never hear me say you men are right!
until the day i die i will not be untrue to myself.
i will hold on to my innocence and never let go!
my conscience will always be clear!
may my enemies be punished like those who are evil.
may those who stood against me end up like all who have done wrong.
what hope do people without god have when it is time to die, when god takes their life away?
when they have troubles and cry out for help, god will not listen to them!
it will be too late for them to enjoy talking with god all-powerful.
they should have prayed to god all the time.
“i will teach you about god’s power.
i will not hide anything about god all-powerful.
but you have seen it all with your own eyes.
so why do you say such useless things?
“here is what god has planned for those who are evil.
this is what cruel people will get from god all-powerful.
they may have many children, but all of them will be killed in war.
or their children will not have enough to eat.
all those who are left will die, and the widows will not even cry for them.
evil people collect silver as easily as dirt.
they may have so many clothes that they are piled up like clay.
but their piles of clothes will be worn by those who have lived right.
all that silver will be given to those who have done no wrong.
evil people might build houses, but they will not last long.
they will be like a spider’s web or a guard’s tent.
they might be rich when they go to bed, but when they open their eyes, all their riches will be gone.
terrible fears will come over them like a flood, like a storm in the night that blows everything away.
the east wind will carry them away, and they will be gone.
the storm will sweep them out of their homes.
they may try to run away from the power of the storm, but it will come down on them without mercy.
it will make a sound like clapping hands as they run away.
it will whistle at them as they run from their homes.” 
judges.
chapter 1.
after joshua died, the israelites prayed to the lord, “which of our tribes should be the first to go and fight for us against the canaanites?” 
the lord said to the israelites, “the tribe of judah will go.
i will let them take this land.” 
the men of judah went to their relatives from the tribe of simeon and asked for help.
they said, “brothers, if you will come and help us fight for the land god gave us, we will go and help you fight for your land.” the men of simeon agreed and went with them.
the lord helped the men of judah defeat the canaanites and the perizzites.
they killed 10,000 men at the city of bezek.
in the city of bezek, they found the ruler of bezek and fought him, and they defeated the canaanites and the perizzites.
the ruler of bezek tried to escape, but the men of judah chased him and caught him.
when they caught him, they cut off his thumbs and big toes.
then the ruler of bezek said, “i cut off the thumbs and big toes of 70 kings.
and they had to eat pieces of food that fell from my table.
now god has paid me back for what i did to them.” the men of judah took the ruler of bezek to jerusalem, and he died there.
the men of judah fought against jerusalem and captured it.
they used their swords to kill the people of jerusalem.
then they burned the city.
later, they went down to fight against some more canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the negev, and in the western foothills.
then the men of judah went to fight against the canaanites who lived in the city of hebron.
(hebron used to be called kiriath arba.)
they defeated the men named sheshai, ahiman, and talmai.
the men of judah left that place.
they went to the city of debir to fight against the people there.
(in the past, debir was called kiriath sepher.)
before they started to fight, caleb made a promise to the men.
he said, “i will give my daughter acsah in marriage to whoever attacks and conquers kiriath sepher.” 
caleb had a younger brother named kenaz.
kenaz had a son named othniel.
othniel captured the city of kiriath sepher.
so caleb gave his daughter acsah to othniel to be his wife.
acsah went to live with othniel.
othniel told acsah to ask her father for some land.
she went to her father.
when she got off her donkey, caleb asked her, “what is wrong?” 
acsah answered him, “give me a blessing.
you gave me dry desert land in the negev.
please give me some land with water on it.” so caleb gave her what she wanted.
he gave her the upper and lower pools of water in that land.
the kenites left the city of palm trees and went with the men of judah.
they went to the desert of judah to live with the people there.
this was in the negev near the city arad.
(the kenites were from the family of moses’ father-in-law.)
some canaanites lived in the city of zephath.
the men of judah and men from the tribe of simeon attacked them and completely destroyed the city.
so they named the city hormah.
the men of judah also captured the cities of gaza, ashkelon, and ekron and all the small towns around them.
the lord was on the side of the men of judah when they fought.
they took the land in the hill country, but they failed to take the land in the valleys, because the people living there had iron chariots.
moses had promised to give the land near hebron to caleb, so that land was given to caleb’s family.
the men of caleb forced the three sons of anak to leave that place.
the tribe of benjamin could not force the jebusites to leave jerusalem.
so even today, the jebusites live with the people of benjamin in jerusalem.
the descendants of joseph went to fight against the city of bethel, and the lord was with them.
they sent some spies to the city of bethel (which was then called luz).
while the spies were watching, they saw a man come out of the city.
they said to the man, “show us a secret way into the city.
if you help us, we will not hurt you.” 
the man showed the spies the secret way into the city.
the men of joseph used their swords to kill the people of bethel.
but they did not hurt the man who helped them or anyone in his family.
the man and his family were allowed to go free.
he went to the land where the hittites lived and built a city.
he named it luz, and that city is still called luz today.
there were canaanites living in the cities of beth shean, taanach, dor, ibleam, megiddo, and the small towns around the cities.
the people from the tribe of manasseh could not force those people to leave their towns.
so the canaanites stayed.
they refused to leave their homes.
later, the israelites grew stronger and forced the canaanites to work as slaves for them.
but the israelites could not force all the canaanites to leave their land.
there were canaanites living in gezer.
and the ephraimites did not make all the canaanites leave their land.
so they continued to live in gezer with the ephraimites.
some canaanites lived in the cities of kitron and nahalol.
the people of zebulun did not force those people to leave their land.
they stayed and lived with the people of zebulun.
but the people of zebulun made them work as slaves.
the people of asher did not force the other people to leave the cities of acco, sidon, ahlab, aczib, helbah, aphek, and rehob.
the people of asher did not force those canaanites to leave their land, so the canaanites continued to live with them.
the people of naphtali did not force the people to leave the cities of beth shemesh and beth anath, so the people of naphtali continued to live with the people in those cities.
those canaanites worked as slaves for the people of naphtali.
the amorites forced the tribe of dan to live in the hill country.
they had to stay in the hills because the amorites would not let them come down to live in the valleys.
the amorites decided to stay in mount heres, aijalon, and shaalbim.
later, when the descendants of joseph grew stronger, they made the amorites work as slaves for them.
the land of the amorites was from scorpion pass to sela and up into the hill country past sela.
chapter 40.
to the director: a song of david.
i called to the lord, and he heard me.
he heard my cries.
he lifted me out of the grave.
he lifted me from that muddy place.
he picked me up, put me on solid ground, and kept my feet from slipping.
he put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our god.
many will see what he did and worship him.
they will put their trust in the lord.
great blessings belong to those who trust in the lord, for those who do not turn to demons and false gods for help.
lord my god, you have done many amazing things!
you have made great plans for us—too many to list.
i could talk on and on about them, because there are too many to count.
lord, you made me understand this: you don’t really want sacrifices and grain offerings.
you don’t want burnt offerings and sin offerings.
so i said, “here i am, ready to do what was written about me in the book.
my god, i am happy to do whatever you want.
i never stop thinking about your teachings.” 
i told the good news of victory to the people in the great assembly.
and, lord, you know that i will never stop telling that good news.
i told about the good things you did.
i did not hide these things in my heart.
i spoke of how you can be trusted to save us.
i did not hide your love and loyalty from those in the great assembly.
lord, do not hide your mercy from me.
let your love and loyalty always protect me.
troubles have surrounded me.
they are too many to count!
my sins have caught me, and i cannot escape them.
they are more than the hairs on my head.
i have lost my courage.
please, lord, rescue me!
lord, hurry and help me!
people are trying to kill me.
please disappoint them.
humiliate them completely!
they wanted to hurt me.
make them run away in shame!
may those who make fun of me be too embarrassed to speak!
but may those who come to you be happy and rejoice.
may those who love being saved by you always be able to say, “praise the lord!” 
my lord, i am only a poor, helpless man, but please pay attention to me.
you are my helper, the one who can save me.
my god, don’t be too late.
chapter 149.
praise the lord!
sing a new song to the lord!
sing his praise in the assembly of his followers.
let israel be happy with their maker.
let the people of zion rejoice with their king.
let them praise him by dancing and playing their tambourines and harps.
the lord is happy with his people.
he did a wonderful thing for his humble people.
he saved them!
let his followers rejoice in this victory!
let them sing for joy, even in their beds!
let the people shout praise to god.
and with a sharp sword in their hand, 
let them take revenge on the other nations.
let them go punish those people.
they will put their kings in chains and their leaders in chains of iron.
they will punish those nations as god commanded.
this is an honor for all his followers.
praise the lord!
chapter 24.
don’t be jealous of evil people.
have no desire to be around them.
in their hearts they plan to do evil.
all they talk about is making trouble.
good homes are built on wisdom and understanding.
knowledge fills the rooms with rare and beautiful treasures.
wisdom makes a man more powerful.
knowledge gives a man strength.
get good advice before you start a war.
to win, you must have many good advisors.
fools cannot understand wisdom.
they have nothing to say when people are discussing important things.
if you start planning ways to do wrong, people will learn that you are a troublemaker.
such foolish plans are wrong, and people have no respect for someone who laughs at what is right.
if you are weak in times of trouble, that is real weakness.
if you see someone on their way to death or in danger of being killed, you must do something to save them.
you cannot say, “it’s none of my business.” the lord knows everything, and he knows why you do things.
he watches you, and he will pay you back for what you do.
my son, eat honey; it is good.
honey straight from the honeycomb is the sweetest.
in the same way, know that wisdom is good for you.
wisdom will give you something to hope for that will not disappoint you.
don’t be like a criminal who makes plans to rob those who are good or take away their homes.
good people might fall again and again, but they always get up.
it is the wicked who are defeated by their troubles.
don’t be happy when your enemy has troubles.
don’t be glad when they fall.
the lord will see this, and he might be upset with you and decide not to punish your enemy.
don’t let those who are evil upset you, and don’t be jealous of them.
they have no hope.
their light will burn out.
son, respect the lord and the king, and don’t join with those who are against them, 
because people like that can quickly be destroyed.
you have no idea how much trouble god and the king can make for their enemies.
these are also words from the wise: a judge must be fair.
he must not support some people simply because he knows them.
the people will turn against a judge who lets the guilty go free.
even the people of other nations will curse him.
but if a judge punishes the guilty, then people will be happy with him, and he will be a blessing to them.
an honest answer is as pleasing as a kiss on the lips.
first get your fields ready, next plant your crops, and then build your house.
don’t speak against someone without a good reason, or you will appear foolish.
don’t say, “you hurt me, so i will do the same to you.
i will punish you for what you did to me.” 
i walked past a field that belonged to a lazy man.
it was a vineyard that belonged to someone who understood nothing.
weeds were growing everywhere!
wild vines covered the ground, and the wall around the vineyard was broken and falling down.
i looked at this and thought about it.
this is what i learned: 
a little sleep, a little rest, folding your arms, and taking a nap— 
these things will make you poor very quickly.
soon you will have nothing, as if a thief broke in and took everything away.
chapter 72.
to solomon.
god, help the king be like you and make fair decisions.
help the king’s son know what justice is.
help the king judge your people fairly.
help him make wise decisions for your poor people.
let there be peace and justice throughout the land, known on every mountain and hill.
may the king be fair to the poor.
may he help the helpless and punish those who hurt them.
may people always fear and respect you, god, as long as the sun shines and the moon is in the sky.
help the king be like rain falling on the fields, like showers falling on the land.
let goodness grow everywhere while he is king.
let peace continue as long as there is a moon.
let his kingdom grow from sea to sea, from the euphrates river to the faraway places on earth.
may all the people living in the desert bow down to him.
may all his enemies bow before him with their faces in the dirt.
may the kings of tarshish and all the faraway lands by the sea bring gifts to him.
may the kings of sheba and seba bring their tribute to him.
may all kings bow down to our king.
may all nations serve him.
our king helps the poor who cry out to him— those in need who have no one to help them.
he feels sorry for all who are weak and poor.
he protects their lives.
he saves them from the cruel people who try to hurt them.
their lives are important to him.
long live the king!
let him receive gold from sheba.
always pray for the king.
ask god to bless him every day.
may the fields grow plenty of grain and the hills be covered with crops.
may the fields be as fertile as lebanon, and may people fill the cities as grass covers a field.
may the king be famous forever.
may people remember his name as long as the sun shines.
may all nations be blessed through him, and may they all bless him.
praise the lord god, the god of israel!
only he can do such amazing things.
praise his glorious name forever!
let his glory fill the whole world.
amen and amen!
(this ends the prayers of david son of jesse.)
chapter 46.
to the director: a song from the korah family.
use the alamoth.
a song.
god is our protection and source of strength.
he is always ready to help us in times of trouble.
so we are not afraid when the earth quakes and the mountains fall into the sea.
we are not afraid when the seas become rough and dark and the mountains tremble.
selah 
there is a river whose streams bring happiness to god’s city, to the holy city of god most high.
god is in that city, so it will never be destroyed.
he is there to help even before sunrise.
nations will shake with fear and kingdoms will fall when god shouts and makes the earth move.
the lord all-powerful is with us.
the god of jacob is our place of safety.
selah 
look at the powerful things the lord has done.
see the awesome things he has done on earth.
he stops wars all over the world.
he breaks the soldiers’ bows, shatters their spears, and burns their shields.
god says, “stop fighting and know that i am god!
i am the one who defeats the nations; i am the one who controls the world.” 
the lord all-powerful is with us.
the god of jacob is our place of safety.
selah 
hosea.
chapter 3.
then the lord said to me again, “gomer has many lovers, but you must continue loving her.
do this because it is an example of the lord’s love for israel.
he continues to love them, but they continue to turn to other gods, and they love to eat those raisin cakes.” 
so i bought gomer back for 6 ounces of silver and 9 bushels of barley.
then i told her, “you must stay at home with me for many days.
you will not be like a prostitute.
you will not have sexual relations with another man.
i will be your husband.” 
in the same way the people of israel will continue many days without a king or a leader.
they will be without a sacrifice or a memorial stone.
they will be without an ephod or a household god.
after this, the people of israel will come back and look for the lord their god and for david their king.
in the last days they will come to honor the lord and his goodness.
chapter 44.
then the man brought me back to the east gate of the temple area.
we were outside the gate and the gate was shut.
the lord said to me, “this gate will stay shut.
it will not be opened.
no one will enter through it, because the lord of israel has entered through it.
so it must stay shut.
only the ruler of the people may sit at this gate when he eats a meal with the lord.
he must enter through the porch of the gateway and go out the same way.” 
then the man led me through the north gate to the front of the temple.
i looked and saw the glory of the lord filling the lord’s temple.
i bowed with my face touching the ground.
the lord said to me, “son of man, look very carefully!
use your eyes and ears.
look at these things, and listen very carefully to everything that i tell you about all the rules and laws about the lord’s temple.
look carefully at the entrances to the temple and at all the exits from the holy place.
then give this message to all the people of israel who refused to obey me.
tell them, ‘this is what the lord god said: family of israel, i have had enough of the terrible things you have done!
you brought foreigners into my temple who are not circumcised and have not given themselves to me.
in this way you made my temple unclean.
you broke our agreement and did terrible things, and then you gave me the offerings of bread, the fat, and the blood.
but this only made my temple unclean.
you did not take care of my holy things.
no, you let foreigners have responsibility of my holy place!’” 
this is what the lord god says: “a foreigner who is not truly circumcised must not come into my temple—not even a foreigner living permanently among the people of israel.
he must be circumcised, and he must give himself completely to me before he can come into my temple.
in the past, the levites left me when israel turned away from me.
israel left me to follow their idols.
the levites will be punished for their sin.
the levites were chosen to serve in my holy place.
they guarded the gates of the temple.
they served in the temple.
they killed the animals for the sacrifices and burnt offerings for the people.
they were chosen to help the people and to serve them.
but the levites helped the people sin against me!
they helped the people worship their idols!
so i am making this promise against them: ‘they will be punished for their sin.’” this is what the lord god said.
“so the levites will not bring offerings to me like the priests.
they will not come near any of my holy things or the things that are most holy.
they must carry their shame because of the terrible things that they did.
but i will let them take care of the temple.
they will work in the temple and do the things that must be done in it.
“the priests are all from the tribe of levi.
but only priests from zadok’s family took care of my holy place when the people of israel turned away from me.
so only zadok’s descendants will bring offerings to me.
they will stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood from the animals they sacrifice.” this is what the lord god said!
“they will enter my holy place and come near my table to serve me.
they will take care of the things i gave them.
when they enter the gates of the inner courtyard, they will wear linen clothes.
they will not wear wool while they serve at the gates of the inner courtyard and in the temple.
they will wear linen turbans on their heads, and they will wear linen underwear.
they will not wear anything that makes them sweat.
before they go out into the outer courtyard to the people, they will take off the clothes they wear while serving me.
they will put these clothes away in the holy rooms.
then they will put on other clothes.
in this way they will not let people touch those holy clothes.
“these priests will not shave their heads or let their hair grow long.
the priests may only trim the hair of their heads.
none of the priests may drink wine when they go into the inner courtyard.
the priests must not marry a widow or a divorced woman.
no, they must only marry a virgin from the family of israel or a woman whose dead husband was a priest.
“also, the priests must teach my people the difference between things that are holy and things that are not holy.
they must help my people know what is clean and what is unclean.
the priests will be the judges in court.
they will follow my laws when they judge people.
they will obey my laws and my rules at all my special feasts.
they will respect my special days of rest and keep them holy.
they will not go near a dead person to make themselves unclean.
but they may make themselves unclean if the dead person is their father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or a sister who is not married.
after the priest has been made clean, he must wait seven days.
then he can go back into the holy place.
but on the day he goes into the inner courtyard to serve in the holy place, he must offer a sin offering for himself.” this is what the lord god said.
“about the land that will belong to the levites: i am their property.
you will not give the levites any land in israel.
i am their share in israel.
they will have the right to eat the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings.
also, anything in israel that is a special gift to god will belong to them.
and the first part of the harvest from every kind of crop will be for the priests.
you will also give the priests the first part of your flour.
this will bring blessings to your house.
the priests must not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces by a wild animal.

chapter 20.
king ben-hadad of aram gathered his army together.
there were 32 kings with him and many horses and chariots.
they surrounded samaria and attacked it.
the king sent messengers to king ahab of israel who was inside the city.
the message was, “ben-hadad says, ‘your silver and your gold are mine, and so are the best of your wives and children.’” 
the king of israel answered, “yes, my lord and king, i am yours now, and everything i have belongs to you.” 
then the messengers came back to ahab.
they said, “ben-hadad says, ‘i told you before that all of your silver and gold and your wives and children belong to me.
so give them to me!
tomorrow i will send my men to search through your house and through the houses of your officials.
give my men all of your valuables, and they will bring them back to me.’” 
so king ahab called a meeting of all the elders of his country and said, “look, ben-hadad is looking for trouble.
first he told me that i must give him my wives and children and my silver and gold.
i agreed to give them to him.” 
but the elders and all the people said, “don’t obey him or do what he says.” 
so ahab sent a message to ben-hadad that said, “i will do what you said at first, but i cannot obey your second command.” king ben-hadad’s men carried the message to the king.
then they came back with another message from ben-hadad that said, “i will completely destroy samaria.
i promise that there will be nothing left of that city!
there will not be enough of that city left for my men to find any souvenirs to take home.
may the gods destroy me if i don’t do this!” 
king ahab answered, “tell ben-hadad that the man who puts on his armor should not boast as much as the man who lives long enough to take it off.” 
king ben-hadad was drinking in his tent with the other rulers when the messengers came back and gave him the message from king ahab.
king ben-hadad commanded his men to prepare to attack the city, so the men moved into their places for the battle.
then a prophet went to king ahab and said, “king ahab, the lord says to you, ‘do you see that great army?
i will defeat that army for you today.
then you will know that i am the lord.’” 
ahab said, “who will you use to defeat them?” the prophet answered, “the lord says, ‘the young men who carry the weapons for the government officials.’” then the king asked, “who should command the main army?” the prophet answered, “you will.” 
so ahab gathered the young helpers of the government officials.
there were 232 of these young men.
then the king called together the army of israel.
the total number was 7000. 
king ahab began his attack at noon, while king ben-hadad and the 32 kings were drinking and getting drunk in their tents.
the young helpers went out first.
king ben-hadad’s men told him that some soldiers had come out of samaria.
so ben-hadad said, “they might be coming to fight or they might be coming to ask for peace.
capture them alive.” 
the young men of king ahab were the first to come out, but the rest of the army of israel was following them.
each of the men of israel killed the man who had come against him.
so the men from aram began to run away and the army of israel chased them.
king ben-hadad escaped on a horse with the chariots.
king ahab led the army and attacked all the horses and chariots.
so king ahab made the arameans suffer a great defeat.
then the prophet went to king ahab and said, “the king of aram will come back to fight again next spring.
so go back and strengthen your army and make careful plans to defend yourself against him.” 
king ben-hadad’s officers said to him, “the gods of israel are mountain gods.
we fought in a mountain area, so the israelites won.
if we fight them on level ground, we will win.
also, don’t let the 32 kings command the armies.
put your commanders in charge of the armies.
let’s gather an army like the one that was destroyed.
gather as many men, horses, and chariots as before, and fight the israelites on level ground.
then we will win.” ben-hadad followed their advice and did what they said.
so in the spring, ben-hadad gathered the men of aram and went to aphek to fight against israel.
the israelites also prepared for war and went to fight the army of aram.
they made their camp opposite the camp of aram.
the aramean soldiers filled the land, but israel’s army looked like two small flocks of goats.
a man of god came to the king of israel with this message: “the lord said, ‘the people of aram said that i, the lord, am a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys.
so i will let you defeat this great army.
then all of you will know that i am the lord, wherever you are!’” 
the armies were camped across from each other for seven days.
on the seventh day the battle began.
the israelites killed 100,000 aramean soldiers in one day.
the survivors ran away to the city of aphek.
the wall of the city fell on 27,000 of those soldiers.
ben-hadad also ran away to the city and hid in a room.
his servants said to him, “we heard that the kings of israel are merciful.
let’s dress in rough cloth with ropes on our heads.
then let’s go to the king of israel.
maybe he will let us live.” 
they dressed in rough cloth with ropes on their heads.
they came to the king of israel.
they said, “your servant, ben-hadad, says, ‘please let me live.’” ahab said, “is he still alive?
he is my brother.” 
ben-hadad’s men wanted king ahab to say something to show that he would not kill king ben-hadad.
when ahab called ben-hadad his brother, the advisors quickly said, “yes!
ben-hadad is your brother.” ahab said, “bring him to me.” so ben-hadad came to king ahab.
king ahab asked him to get in the chariot with him.
ben-hadad said to him, “ahab, i will give you the towns that my father took from your father.
and you can put shops in damascus, as my father did in samaria.” ahab answered, “if you agree to this, i will let you go free.” so the two kings made a peace agreement.
then king ahab let king ben-hadad go free.
one of the prophets told another prophet, “hit me!” he said that because the lord had commanded it.
but the other prophet refused to hit him.
so the first prophet said, “you did not obey the lord’s command.
so a lion will kill you when you leave this place.” when the second prophet left, a lion killed him.
the first prophet went to another man and said, “hit me!” this man hit him and hurt the prophet.
so the prophet wrapped his face with a cloth.
this way no one could see who he was.
the prophet went and waited for the king by the road.
the king came by and the prophet said to him, “i went to fight in the battle.
one of our men brought an enemy soldier to me.
the man said, ‘guard this man.
if he runs away, you will have to give your life in his place or you will have to pay a fine of 75 pounds of silver.’ 
while i was busy doing other things, the man ran away.” the king of israel answered, “you admitted that you are guilty, so you know the answer.
you must do what the man said.” 
then the prophet quickly took the cloth from his face, and the king of israel saw that he was one of the prophets.
then the prophet said to the king, “the lord says to you, ‘you set free the man i said should die.
so you will take his place—you and your people will die!’” 
then the king went back home to samaria.
he was worried and upset.
chapter 13.
“the tribe of ephraim made itself very important in israel.
ephraim spoke and people shook with fear.
but ephraim sinned by worshiping baal, so he must die.
now the israelites sin more and more.
they make idols for themselves.
workers make those fancy statues from silver, and then they talk to their statues.
they offer sacrifices to them, and they kiss those calf idols.
that is why those people will soon disappear.
they will be like a fog that comes early in the morning and then quickly disappears.
the israelites will be like chaff that is blown from the threshing floor.
the israelites will be like smoke that goes out a window and disappears.
“i have been the lord your god since the time you were in the land of egypt.
you did not know any other god except me.
i am the one who saved you.
i knew you in the desert—i knew you in that dry land.
i gave food to the israelites, and they ate it.
they became full and satisfied.
they became proud, and then they forgot me.
“that is why i will be like a lion to them.
i will be like a leopard waiting by the road.
i will attack them like a bear whose cubs were robbed from her.
i will attack them and rip open their chests.
i will be like a lion or other wild animal tearing and eating its prey.
“israel, i helped you, but you turned against me.
so now i will destroy you.
where is your king?
can he save you in any of your cities?
where are your judges?
you asked for them, saying, ‘give me a king and leaders.’ 
i was angry, and i gave you a king.
and when i became very angry, i took him away.
“ephraim tried to hide his guilt.
he thought his sins were a secret, but he will be punished.
his punishment will be like the pain of a woman giving birth.
he will not be a wise son.
the time will come for his birth, and he will not survive.
“i will save them from the grave.
i will rescue them from death.
death, where are your diseases?
grave, where is your power?
i am not looking for revenge.
israel grows among his brothers, but a powerful east wind will come—the lord’s wind will blow from the desert.
then his well will dry up.
his spring of water will be dry.
the wind will take away anything of value.
samaria must be punished because she turned against her god.
the israelites will be killed with swords.
their children will be torn to pieces, and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”

chapter 18.
jehoshaphat became very rich and famous.
he made an agreement with king ahab through marriage.
a few years later, jehoshaphat visited ahab in the town of samaria.
ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for jehoshaphat and the people with him.
ahab encouraged jehoshaphat to join in an attack on the city of ramoth gilead.
ahab said to jehoshaphat, “will you go with me to attack ramoth gilead?” ahab was the king of israel and jehoshaphat was the king of judah.
jehoshaphat answered, “yes, you and i will be as one—my men will be as yours in battle.
but first let’s ask the lord for advice.” 
so ahab called a meeting of the prophets.
there were about 400 prophets at that time.
ahab asked the prophets, “should we go and attack ramoth gilead or not?” the prophets answered ahab, “yes, because god will let you defeat ramoth gilead.” 
but jehoshaphat said, “doesn’t the lord have another prophet here?
let’s ask him what god says.” 
king ahab answered, “yes, there is another prophet.
his name is micaiah son of imlah.
but i hate him.
he never says anything good about me when he speaks for the lord.
he always says things that i don’t like.” jehoshaphat said, “the king shouldn’t say things like that!” 
so king ahab told one of his officers to go and find micaiah.
at that time the two kings were sitting on their thrones, with their royal robes on, at the judgment place near the gates of samaria.
all the prophets were standing before them, prophesying.
one of the prophets was named zedekiah son of kenaanah.
zedekiah made some iron horns and said to ahab, “the lord says, ‘you will use these iron horns to fight against the army of aram.
you will defeat them and destroy them.’” 
all the other prophets agreed with zedekiah and said, “your army should march now to go fight against the arameans at ramoth gilead.
you will win the battle.
the lord will let you defeat them.” 
while this was happening, the officer went to find micaiah.
when he found him, the officer told him, “all the other prophets have said that the king will succeed, so you should say the same thing.” 
but micaiah answered, “as surely as the lord lives, i can say only what my god says.” 
micaiah went and stood before king ahab.
the king asked him, “micaiah, should we go and attack the arameans at ramoth gilead or not?” micaiah answered, “yes, go and be successful!
you will take the city.” 
but ahab answered, “how many times do i have to tell you?
tell me the truth.
what does the lord say?” 
so micaiah answered, “i can see the army of israel scattered all over the hills, like sheep with no one to lead them.
this is what the lord says: ‘these men have no leaders.
let them go home in peace.’” 
then ahab said to jehoshaphat, “see, i told you!
this prophet never says anything good about me.
he always says something bad.” 
micaiah said, “hear the message from the lord: i saw the lord sitting on his throne.
all of heaven’s army was standing around him, some on his left side and some on his right side.
the lord said, ‘which of you will go fool ahab into attacking the arameans at ramoth gilead so that he will be killed?’ the angels discussed many different plans.
then a spirit went and stood before the lord.
he said, ‘i will fool him!’ the lord asked, ‘how will you do it?’ 
he answered, ‘i will go out and become a spirit of lies in the mouths of ahab’s prophets—they will all speak lies.’ so the lord said, ‘yes, that will fool ahab.
go out and do that!’ 
“so that is what has happened here.
the lord made your prophets lie to you.
the lord himself decided to bring this disaster to you.” 
then the prophet zedekiah went to micaiah and hit him on the face.
zedekiah said, “how is it that the spirit of the lord left me to speak through you?” 
micaiah answered, “look, what i said will happen!
and when you see it, you will go into the deepest part of your house to hide!” 
then king ahab ordered one of his officers to arrest micaiah.
ahab said, “arrest him and take him to amon the governor of the city and prince joash.
tell them to put micaiah in prison.
give him nothing but bread and water to eat.
keep him there until i come home from the battle.” 
micaiah said, “listen to me, everyone!
ahab, if you come back alive from the battle, the lord has not spoken through me.” 
king ahab of israel and king jehoshaphat of judah went to fight the arameans at ramoth gilead.
ahab said to jehoshaphat, “disguise yourself when you go into battle, but wear your own clothes.
and i will disguise myself.” the king of israel went into battle dressed like an ordinary soldier.
the king of aram had 32 chariot commanders.
he gave them this command, “don’t go after anyone except the king of israel, no matter how important they are!” 
during the battle, the commanders saw king jehoshaphat and thought he was the king of israel.
so they went to kill him.
jehoshaphat started shouting, and the lord helped him.
god made the chariot commanders turn away from jehoshaphat.
when the commanders saw that he was not king ahab, they stopped chasing him.
then a soldier pulled back on his bow and shot an arrow into the air.
by chance it hit the king of israel between two pieces of his armor.
king ahab said to his chariot driver, “i’ve been hit!
turn the chariot around and take me off the battlefield!” 
the armies continued fighting all that day.
king ahab leaned against the side of his chariot to hold himself up, facing the arameans.
he watched until evening.
then, just as the sun was setting, he died.
chapter 7.
the lord said to moses, “see how important i have made you?
in speaking to pharaoh, you will be like god, and your brother aaron will be your prophet.
you will tell aaron everything that i command you.
then he will tell the king what i say.
and pharaoh will let the israelites leave this country.
but i will make pharaoh stubborn so that he will not do what you tell him.
then i will do many miracles in egypt to prove who i am.
but he will still refuse to listen.
so then i will punish egypt very much.
and i will lead my army, my people, out of that land.
i will punish the people of egypt, and they will learn that i am the lord.
then i will lead my people out of their country.” 
moses and aaron did what the lord told them.
moses was 80 years old at the time, and aaron was 83. 
the lord said to moses and aaron, 
“pharaoh will ask you to prove your power.
he will ask you to do a miracle.
tell aaron to throw his walking stick on the ground.
while pharaoh is watching, the stick will become a snake.” 
so moses and aaron went to pharaoh and obeyed the lord.
aaron threw his walking stick down.
while pharaoh and his officers watched, the stick became a snake.
so pharaoh called for his wise men and magicians.
these men used their magic, and they were able to do the same thing as aaron.
they threw their walking sticks on the ground, and their sticks became snakes.
but then aaron’s walking stick ate theirs.
pharaoh still refused to let the people go, just as the lord had said.
pharaoh refused to listen to moses and aaron.
then the lord said to moses, “pharaoh is being stubborn.
he refuses to let the people go.
in the morning pharaoh will go out to the river.
go to him by the edge of the nile river.
take the walking stick that became a snake.
tell him this: ‘the lord, the god of the hebrews, sent me to you.
he told me to tell you to let his people go worship him in the desert.
until now you have not listened to the lord.
so the lord says that he will do something to show you that he is the lord.
i will hit the water of the nile river with this walking stick in my hand, and the river will turn into blood.
the fish in the river will die, and the river will begin to stink.
then the egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the river.’” 
the lord said to moses: “tell aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the rivers, canals, lakes, and every place where they store water.
when he does this, all the water will turn into blood.
all the water, even the water stored in wood and stone jars, will turn into blood.” 
so moses and aaron did what the lord commanded.
aaron raised the walking stick and hit the water in the nile river.
he did this in front of pharaoh and his officials.
so all the water in the river changed into blood.
the fish in the river died, and the river began to stink.
so the egyptians could not drink water from the river.
the blood was everywhere in egypt.
the magicians used their magic to do the same thing.
so pharaoh refused to listen to moses and aaron.
this happened just as the lord said.
pharaoh ignored what moses and aaron had done.
he turned and went into his house.
the egyptians could not drink the water from the river, so they dug wells around the river for water to drink.
seven days passed after the lord changed the nile river.
chapter 18.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“why do you people say this proverb: ‘the parents ate the sour grapes, but the children got the sour taste’?” 
but the lord god says, “by my life, i swear that people in israel will not think this proverb is true anymore!
i will treat everyone, child and parent, just the same.
the one who sins is the one who will die!
“a person who is good will live!
he is fair and does what is right.
he doesn’t go to the mountains to share food offered to idols.
he doesn’t pray to those filthy idols in israel.
he doesn’t commit adultery with his neighbor’s wife or with a woman during her period.
he doesn’t take advantage of others.
if someone borrows money from him, he might take something of value before he gives the money.
but when that person pays him back, he returns what he took.
he gives food to the hungry and clothes to people who need them.
if someone wants to borrow money from him, he lends the money and doesn’t charge interest on the loan.
he refuses to be crooked.
he is always fair with everyone.
people can trust him.
he obeys my laws and studies my rules so that he can learn to be fair and dependable.
he is good, so he will live.” this is what the lord god said.
“but someone like that might have a son who does not do any of these good things.
the son steals things and kills people.
he does things his father never did.
he goes to the mountains and eats foods offered to false gods.
he commits the sin of adultery with his neighbor’s wife.
he mistreats poor, helpless people.
he takes advantage of them.
when a debt is paid, he does not give back what he took from them.
he prays to filthy idols and does other terrible things.
he lends money to people who need it, but he forces them to pay interest on the loan.
the evil son will not be allowed to live.
he will be put to death because he did such terrible things, and he will be responsible for his own death.
“now, that evil son might also have a son.
but this son sees the bad things his father did, and he refuses to live as his father did.
he treats people fairly.
he does not go to the mountains and eat foods offered to false gods.
he does not pray to filthy idols in israel.
he does not commit the sin of adultery with his neighbor’s wife.
he does not take advantage of people.
if someone borrows money from him, the good son takes something of value and then gives the other person the money.
when that person pays him back, the good son gives back what he took.
the good son gives food to hungry people, and he gives clothes to those who need them.
he helps the poor.
if people want to borrow money, the good son lends them the money, and he does not charge interest on the loan.
he obeys my laws and follows them.
he will not be put to death for his father’s sins.
the good son will live.
the father hurts people and steals things.
he never does anything good for my people!
he will die because of his own sins.
“you might ask, ‘why will the son not be punished for his father’s sins?’ the reason is that the son was fair and did good things.
he very carefully obeyed my laws, so he will live.
the one who sins is the one who will be put to death.
a son will not be punished for his father’s sins, and a father will not be punished for his son’s sins.
a good man’s goodness belongs to him alone, and a bad man’s evil belongs to him alone.
“now, if evil people change their lives, they will live and not die.
they might stop doing all the bad things they did and begin to carefully obey all my laws.
they might become fair and good.
god will not remember all the bad things they did.
he will remember only their goodness, so they will live!” 
the lord god says, “i don’t want evil people to die.
i want them to change their lives so that they can live!
“now, maybe good people might stop being good.
they might change their lives and begin to do all the terrible things that evil people have done in the past.
(the evil people changed, so they can live.)
so if those good people change and become bad, god will not remember all the good things they did.
he will remember that they turned against him and began to sin.
so they will die because of their sin.
“you people might say, ‘the lord isn’t fair!’ but listen, family of israel.
i am fair.
you are the ones who are not fair!
if good people change and become evil, they must die for the bad things they do.
and if evil people change and become good and fair, they will save their lives.
they will live!
they saw how wicked they were and came back to me.
they stopped doing the evil things they did in the past.
so they will live!
they will not die!” 
the people of israel said, “that’s not fair!
the lord isn’t fair!” “i am fair!
you are the ones who are not fair!
because, family of israel, i will judge each of you only for what you do!” this is what the lord god said.
“so come back to me!
stop committing those crimes and do away with those things that cause you to sin!
throw away all the terrible idols with which you committed your crimes!
change your heart and spirit.
people of israel, why should you do things that will cost you your life?
i don’t want to kill you!
please come back and live!” this is what the lord god said.

chapter 34.
josiah was eight years old when he became king.
he was king for 31 years in jerusalem.
he lived in a way that pleased the lord, always doing what was right, as his ancestor david had done.
josiah never changed this way of life.
when josiah was in his eighth year as king, he began to follow the god worshiped by david his ancestor.
he was still young when he began to obey god.
when he was in his twelfth year as king he began to destroy the high places, the asherah poles, and idols that were carved and idols that were made from molds from judah and jerusalem.
as josiah watched, the people broke down the altars for the baal gods.
then he cut down the incense altars that stood high above the people.
he broke the idols that were carved and the idols that were made from molds.
he beat the idols into powder and sprinkled the powder on the graves of the people who had offered sacrifices to the baal gods.
josiah even burned the bones of the priests who had served the baal gods on their own altars.
this is how he destroyed idols and idol worship from judah and jerusalem.
josiah did the same for the towns in the areas of manasseh, ephraim, simeon, and all the way to naphtali.
he did the same for the ruins near all these towns.
josiah broke down the altars and the asherah poles.
he beat the idols into powder.
he cut down all the incense altars used for baal worship in all the country of israel.
then he went back to jerusalem.
when josiah was in his 18th year as king of judah, he sent shaphan, maaseiah, and joah to rebuild and repair the temple of the lord his god.
shaphan was the son of azaliah.
maaseiah was the city leader.
joah, who was the son of joahaz, wrote about what happened.
so josiah commanded the temple to be repaired so that he could make judah and the temple clean.
these men came to hilkiah the high priest.
they gave him the money that people gave for god’s temple.
the levite doorkeepers had collected this money from the people of manasseh, ephraim, and from all the israelites who were left.
they also collected this money from all judah, benjamin, and all the people living in jerusalem.
then the levites paid the men who supervised the work on the lord’s temple.
and the supervisors paid the workers who repaired the lord’s temple.
they gave the money to carpenters and builders to buy large rocks that were already cut, and to buy wood.
the wood was used to rebuild the buildings and to make beams for the buildings.
in the past, the kings of judah did not take care of the temple buildings.
the buildings had become old and ruined.
the men worked faithfully.
their supervisors were jahath and obadiah.
jahath and obadiah were levites, and they were descendants of merari.
other supervisors were zechariah and meshullam.
they were descendants of kohath.
the levites who were skilled in playing instruments of music also supervised the laborers and all the other workers.
some levites worked as secretaries, officials, and doorkeepers.
the levites brought out the money that was in the lord’s temple.
at that time hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the lord that was given through moses.
hilkiah said to shaphan the secretary, “i found the book of the law in the lord’s house.” hilkiah gave the book to shaphan.
shaphan brought the book to king josiah.
shaphan reported to the king, “your servants are doing everything you told them to do.
they got the money that was in the lord’s temple and are paying the supervisors and the workers.” 
then shaphan said to king josiah, “hilkiah the priest gave a book to me.” then shaphan read from the book in front of the king.
when king josiah heard the words of the law being read, he tore his clothes.
then the king gave a command to hilkiah, ahikam son of shaphan, abdon son of micah, shaphan the secretary, and asaiah the servant.
the king said, “go, ask the lord for me and for the people who are left in israel and in judah.
ask about the words in the book that was found.
the lord is very angry with us because our ancestors did not obey the lord’s word.
they did not do everything this book says to do.” 
hilkiah and the king’s servants went to the newer part of jerusalem to see huldah the prophetess.
she was the wife of shallum, the son of tokhath, whose father was hasrah.
shallum had the job of taking care of the king’s clothes.
hilkiah and the king’s servants told huldah what had happened.
huldah said to them, “this is what the lord, the god of israel, says: tell king josiah that 
the lord says, ‘i will bring trouble to this place and to the people living here.
i will bring all the terrible things that are written in the book that was read in front of the king of judah.
i will do this because the people left me and burned incense to other gods.
they made me angry because of all the bad things they have done.
so i will pour out my anger on this place.
like a hot burning fire, my anger will not be put out!’ 
“go back to king josiah of judah, who sent you to ask what the lord wants.
tell him, ‘this is what the lord, the god of israel, says about the words you heard being read: 
josiah, when you heard my words against this city and its people, you were sorry and humbled yourself before me.
you even tore your clothes to show your sorrow and cried before me.
because your heart was tender, i the lord, have heard you.
i will take you to be with your ancestors.
you will go to your grave in peace.
you will not have to see any of the trouble that i will bring on this place and on the people living here.’” hilkiah and the king’s servants brought back this message to king josiah.
then king josiah called for all the elders of judah and jerusalem to come and meet with him.
the king went up to the lord’s temple.
all the people from judah, the people living in jerusalem, the priests, the levites, and all the people, both important and not important, were with josiah.
he read to them all the words in the book of the agreement.
that book was found in the lord’s temple.
then the king stood up in his place.
he made an agreement with the lord.
he agreed to follow the lord and to obey his commands, laws, and rules.
he agreed to obey with all his heart and soul the words of the agreement written in this book.
then josiah made all the people in jerusalem and benjamin promise to accept the agreement.
the people of jerusalem obeyed the agreement of god, the god their ancestors obeyed.
the israelites had idols from many different countries, but josiah destroyed all the terrible idols.
he made all the people in israel serve the lord their god.
and as long as josiah was alive, the people continued to serve the lord, the god of their ancestors.
chapter 4.
“son of man, take a brick and scratch a picture on it.
draw a picture of a city—the city of jerusalem.
and then pretend you are an army surrounding the city.
build a dirt wall around the city to help you attack it.
build a dirt road leading up to the city wall.
bring battering rams and set up army camps around the city.
and then take an iron pan and put it between you and the city.
it will be like an iron wall separating you and the city.
in this way you will show that you are against it.
you will surround the city and attack it.
this is an example for the family of israel to show that i will destroy jerusalem.
“then you must lie down on your left side.
you must do this thing that shows that you are taking the sins of the people of israel on yourself.
you will carry the guilt for as many days as you lie on your left side.
you must bear the guilt of israel for 390 days.
in this way i am telling you how long israel will be punished; one day equals one year.
“after that time, you will lie on your right side for 40 days.
this time you will bear the guilt of judah for 40 days.
one day equals one year.
i am telling you how long judah must be punished.
“now, roll up your sleeve and raise your arm over the brick.
act like you are attacking the city of jerusalem.
do this to show that you are speaking as my messenger to the people.
now look, i am tying ropes on you.
you will not be able to roll over from one side to the other until your attack against the city is finished.
“you must get some grain to make bread.
get some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt.
mix all these things together in one bowl and grind them to make flour.
you will use this flour to make bread.
you will eat only this bread during the 390 days that you lie on your side.
you will be allowed to use only 1 cup of that flour each day to make bread.
you will eat that bread from time to time throughout the day.
you can drink only 3 cups of water each day.
you can drink it from time to time throughout the day.
you must make your bread each day.
you must get dry human dung and burn it.
then you must cook the bread over this burning dung.
you must eat this bread in front of the people.” 
then the lord said, “this will show that the family of israel will eat unclean bread in foreign countries and that i am the one who forced them to leave israel and go to those countries!” 
then i said, “oh, but lord god, i have never eaten any unclean food.
i have never eaten meat from an animal that died from a disease or from an animal that was killed by a wild animal.
i have never eaten unclean meat—not from the time that i was a little baby until now.
none of that bad meat ever entered my mouth.” 
then god said to me, “very well, i will let you use dry cow dung to cook your bread.
you don’t have to use dry human dung.” 
then god said to me, “son of man, i am destroying jerusalem’s supply of bread.
people will have only a little bread to eat.
they will be very worried about their food supply, and they will have only a little water to drink.
every time they take a drink, they will feel more afraid.
that is because there will not be enough food and water for everyone.
they will be terrified as they watch each other wasting away because of their sins.
chapter 7.
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, “now, son of man, here is a message from the lord god.
this message is for the land of israel: “the end!
the end is coming.
the whole country will be destroyed.
your end is coming now!
i will show how angry i am with you.
i will punish you for the evil things you did.
i will make you pay for all the terrible things you did.
i will not show you any mercy or feel sorry for you.
i am punishing you for the evil things you did.
you have done such terrible things.
now, you will know that i am the lord.” 
this is what the lord god said: “there will be one disaster after another!
the end is coming, and it will come quickly!
you people living in israel, disaster is coming.
it is time for punishment.
those are not shouts of joy in the mountains.
those are cries of panic.
very soon now, i will show you how angry i am.
i will show all of my anger against you.
i will punish you for the evil things you did.
i will make you pay for all the terrible things you did.
i will not show you any mercy or feel sorry for you.
i am punishing you for the evil things you did.
you have done such terrible things.
now, you will know that i am the lord.
“that time of punishment has come like a plant sprouting, budding, and flowering.
god has given the signal, the enemy is prepared, and their proud king is ready.
this violent man is ready to punish the evil people.
there are many people in israel—but he is not one of them.
he is not a person in that crowd.
he is not some important leader from them.
“the time of punishment has come.
the day is here.
those who buy things will not be happy, and those who sell things will not feel bad about selling them because that terrible punishment will happen to everyone.
the people who sold their property will never go back to it.
even if some people escape alive, they will never go back to their property, because this vision is for the whole crowd.
so even if some people escape alive, it will not make everyone feel better.
“they will blow the trumpet to warn the people.
the people will get ready for battle, but they will not go out to fight because i will show the whole crowd how angry i am.
the enemy with his sword is outside the city.
disease and hunger is inside the city.
if some people go out into the fields, enemy soldiers will kill them.
if they stay in the city, hunger and disease will destroy them.
“but some people will escape.
the survivors will run to the mountains, but they will not be happy.
they will be sad for all their sins.
they will cry and make sad noises like doves.
they will be too tired and sad to raise their arms.
their legs will be like water.
they will wear sackcloth and be covered with fear.
you will see the shame on every face.
they will shave their heads to show their sadness.
they will throw their silver idols into the streets.
they will treat their gold statues like dirty rags, because those things will not be able to save them when the lord shows his anger.
those things were nothing but a trap that caused the people to fall.
they will not give food to the people or put food in their bellies.
“they used their beautiful jewelry and made an idol.
they were proud of that statue.
they made their terrible statues.
they made those filthy things, so i will throw them away like a dirty rag.
i will let strangers take them.
those strangers will make fun of them.
they will kill some of the people and take others away as prisoners.
i will turn my head away from them—i will not look at them.
the strangers will ruin my temple—they will go into the secret parts of that holy building and make it unfit for worship.
“make chains for the prisoners, because many people will be punished for killing other people.
there will be violence every place in the city.
i will bring evil people from other nations, and they will get all the houses of the people of israel.
i will stop all you powerful people from being so proud.
those people from other nations will get all your places of worship.
“you will shake with fear.
you will look for peace, but there will be none.
you will hear one sad story after another.
you will hear nothing but bad news.
you will look for a prophet and ask him for a vision.
the priests will have nothing to teach you, and the elders will not have any good advice to give you.
your king will be crying for the people who died.
the leaders will wear sackcloth.
the common people will be very afraid, because i will pay them back for what they did.
i will decide their punishment, and i will punish them.
then they will know that i am the lord.” 
nehemiah.
chapter 11.
now the leaders of the israelites moved into the city of jerusalem.
the rest of the people used lots to decide who else should move there with the leaders.
they chose a tenth of the people to live in jerusalem, the holy city.
the rest of the people stayed in their own towns.
the people who stayed asked god to bless those who were willing to move to jerusalem.
some of the israelites, priests, levites, servants, and descendants of solomon’s servants lived in the various towns throughout judah.
these all lived on property they owned in these towns.
but the area leaders lived in jerusalem.
and other people from the families of judah and benjamin lived in jerusalem.
these are the descendants of judah who moved into jerusalem: athaiah son of uzziah (the son of zechariah, who was the son of amariah, who was the son of shephatiah, who was the son of mahalalel, who was a descendant of perez) 
and maaseiah son of baruch (the son of col-hozeh, who was the son of hazaiah, who was the son of adaiah, who was the son of joiarib, who was the son of zechariah, who was a descendant of shelah).
the number of perez’s descendants living in jerusalem was 468. all of them were brave men.
these are the descendants of benjamin who moved into jerusalem: sallu son of meshullam (the son of joed, who was the son of pedaiah, who was the son of kolaiah, who was the son of maaseiah, who was the son of ithiel, who was the son of jeshaiah), 
and those who followed jeshaiah were gabbai and sallai.
all together there were 928 men.
joel son of zicri was in charge of them.
and judah son of hassenuah was in charge of the second district of the city of jerusalem.
these are the priests who moved into jerusalem: jedaiah son of joiarib, jakin, 
and seraiah son of hilkiah (the son of meshullam, who was the son of zadok, who was the son of meraioth, who was the son of ahitub), who was the supervisor in the temple of god, 
and 822 men of their brothers that did the work for the temple, and adaiah son of jeroham (the son of pelaliah, who was the son of amzi, who was the son of zechariah, who was the son of pashhur, who was the son of malkijah), 
and 242 men who were adaiah’s brothers (leaders of their families), amashsai son of azarel (the son of ahzai, who was the son of meshillemoth, who was the son of immer), 
and 128 of amashsai’s brothers.
(these men were brave soldiers.
the officer over them was zabdiel son of haggedolim.)
these are the levites who moved into jerusalem: shemaiah son of hasshub (the son of azrikam, who was the son of hashabiah, who was the son of bunni), 
shabbethai and jozabad (two of the leaders of the levites in charge of the outside work of god’s temple), 
mattaniah (the son of mica, who was the son of zabdi, who was the son of asaph), the director who led the people in singing songs of praise and prayer, bakbukiah (the second in charge over his brothers), and abda son of shammua (the son of galal, who was the son of jeduthun).
so there were 284 levites who moved into jerusalem, the holy city.
these are the gatekeepers who moved into jerusalem: akkub, talmon, and 172 of their brothers.
they watched and guarded the gates of the city.
the other israelites, and the other priests and levites, lived in all the towns of judah.
everyone lived on the land that their ancestors had owned.
the temple servants lived on the hill of ophel.
ziha and gishpa were in charge of the temple servants.
the officer over the levites in jerusalem was uzzi.
uzzi was the son of bani (the son of hashabiah, who was the son of mattaniah, who was the son of mica).
uzzi was a descendant of asaph.
asaph’s descendants were the singers who were responsible for the service in god’s temple.
the singers obeyed orders from the king, which told them what to do from day to day.
pethahiah son of meshezabel told the people what the king wanted done.
(meshezabel was one of the descendants of zerah.
zerah was judah’s son.)
the people of judah lived in these towns: in kiriath arba and the small towns around it, in dibon and the small towns around it, in jekabzeel and the small towns around it, 
and in jeshua, in moladah, in beth pelet, 
in hazar shual, in beersheba and the small towns around it, 
and in ziklag, in meconah and the small towns around it, 
and in en rimmon, in zorah, in jarmuth, 
and in zanoah and adullam and the small towns around them, in lachish and the fields around it, and in azekah and the small towns around it.
so the people of judah were living all the way from beersheba to the valley of hinnom.
the descendants of the family of benjamin from geba lived in micmash, aija, bethel, and the small towns around it, 
in anathoth, nob, and ananiah, 
in hazor, ramah, and gittaim, 
in hadid, zeboim, and neballat, 
in lod and ono, and in the valley of the craftsmen.
some of the groups from the family of levi moved to the land of benjamin.

hilkiah was hosah’s second son, tebaliah his third, and zechariah his fourth son.
in all hosah had 13 sons and relatives who were gatekeepers.

some of them were found among the hebron family living in the town of jazer in gilead.
jeriah had 2700 relatives who were powerful men and leaders of families.

chapter 12.
“these are the laws and rules that you must obey in your new land.
you must carefully obey them as long as you live in this land.
the lord is the god of your ancestors, and he is giving this land to you.
you will take that land from the nations that live there now.
you must completely destroy all the places where the people of these nations worship their gods.
these places are on high mountains, on hills, and under green trees.
you must smash their altars and break their memorial stones into pieces.
you must burn their asherah poles and cut down the statues of their gods.
wipe out everything that would remind you of those gods.
“you must not worship the lord your god in the same way these people worship their gods.
the lord your god will choose a special place among your tribes.
that will be the home for his name.
you must go to that place to worship him.
there you must bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, one-tenth of your crops and animals, your special gifts, any gifts you promised to him, any special gift you want to give, and the first animals born in your herds and flocks.
you and your families will eat together at that place, and the lord your god will be there with you.
you will enjoy sharing the things you worked for there.
you will remember that the lord your god blessed you and gave you these good things.
“you must not continue to worship the way we have been worshiping.
until now each of us has been worshiping god any way we wanted.
this is because we have not yet entered the peaceful land that the lord your god is giving you.
but you will go across the jordan river and live in the land that the lord your god is giving you.
there he will give you rest from all your enemies, and you will be safe.
then the lord your god will choose a place that will be the home for his name.
you must bring everything i command you to that place.
bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, one-tenth of your crops and animals, your special gifts, and any gifts that you promised to give to the lord.
come to that place with all your people—your children, all your servants, and the levites living in your towns.
(these levites will not have a share of the land for their own.)
enjoy yourselves together there with the lord your god.
be sure you don’t offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see.
the lord will choose his special place among your tribes.
offer your burnt offerings and do everything else i told you only in that place.
“whenever you want to eat meat, you can enjoy that blessing from the lord your god wherever you live.
you can butcher the animal just as you do gazelles and deer, and anyone, clean or unclean, can eat it.
but you must not eat the blood.
you must pour the blood on the ground like water.
“also, the things you are offering to god must not be eaten where you live.
these include the part of your grain that belongs to god, the part of your new wine and oil that belongs to god, the first animals born in your herd or flock, any gift that you promised to god, any special gifts you want to give, or any other gifts for god.
you must eat these offerings only in his presence at the special place that the lord your god will choose.
you must go there and eat together with your sons, your daughters, all your servants, and the levites living in your towns.
enjoy yourselves there with the lord your god.
enjoy what you have worked for.
but be sure that you always share these meals with the levites.
do this as long as you live in your land.
“the lord your god promised to make your country larger.
when he does this, you might live too far from the place the lord your god chooses to be the home for his name.
if it is too far, and you are hungry for meat, you may eat any meat you have.
you may kill any animal from the herd or flock that he has given you.
do this the way i have commanded you.
you may eat this meat there where you live any time you want.
you may eat this meat the same as you would eat gazelle or deer meat.
anyone can do this—people who are clean and people who are unclean.
but be especially careful not to eat the blood, because the life is in the blood.
you must not eat meat that still has its life in it.
don’t eat the blood.
pour it out like water onto the ground.
so don’t eat blood.
you must do what the lord says is right, and good things will happen to you and to your descendants.
“if you decide to give something special to god, you must go to the special place that the lord your god will choose.
and if you make a special promise, you must go to that place to give that gift to god.
you must offer your burnt offerings in that place.
offer the meat and the blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the lord your god.
for your other sacrifices, you must pour the blood on the altar of the lord your god.
then you may eat the meat.
carefully obey all the commands that i give you.
when you do what is good and right—what pleases the lord your god—then everything will go well for you and for your descendants forever.
“you are going to take your land from other people.
the lord your god will destroy these people for you.
you will force them out of that land, and then you will live there.
but be careful that you don’t fall into the same trap they did!
don’t go to their false gods for help.
don’t say to yourself, ‘they worshiped these gods, so i will worship them too.’ 
don’t do that to the lord your god!
these people do all kinds of bad things that the lord hates.
they even burn their children as sacrifices to their gods!
“you must be careful to do everything i command you.
don’t add anything to what i tell you, and don’t take anything away.
chapter 25.
then bildad from shuah answered: 
“god is the ruler.
he makes people fear and respect him.
he keeps peace in his kingdom above.
no one can count his stars.
his sun rises on all people.
how can anyone claim to be right before god?
no human being can really be pure.
in god’s eyes even the moon is not pure and bright; even the stars are not pure.
people are much less pure.
they are like maggots, as worthless as worms!” 
ezekiel.
chapter 39.
“son of man, speak against gog for me.
tell him that this is what the lord god says: ‘gog, you are the most important leader of the countries meshech and tubal, but i am against you.
i will capture you and bring you back.
i will bring you from the far north.
i will bring you to fight against the mountains of israel.
but i will knock your bow from your left hand and your arrows from your right hand.
you will be killed on the mountains of israel.
you, your groups of soldiers, and all the other nations with you will be killed in the battle.
i will give you as food to every kind of bird that eats meat and to all the wild animals.
you will not enter the city.
you will be killed out in the open fields.
i have spoken!’” this is what the lord god said.
“i will send fire against magog and those people living along the coast.
they think they are safe, but they will know that i am the lord.
and i will make my holy name known among my people israel.
i will not let people ruin my holy name anymore.
the nations will know that i am the lord.
they will know that i am the holy one in israel.
that time is coming!
it will happen!” this is what the lord god said.
“that is the day i am talking about.
“at that time people living in the cities of israel will go out to the fields.
they will collect the enemy’s weapons and burn them.
they will burn all the shields, bows and arrows, clubs and spears.
they will use the weapons as firewood for seven years.
they will not have to gather wood from the fields or chop firewood from the forests because they will use the weapons as firewood.
they will take the valuable things from the soldiers who wanted to steal from them.
they will take the good things from the soldiers who took good things from them.” this is what the lord god said.
“at that time i will choose a place in israel to bury gog.
he will be buried in the valley of the travelers, east of the dead sea.
it will block the road for travelers, because gog and all his army will be buried in that place.
people will call it ‘the valley of gog’s army.’ 
it will take seven months for the family of israel to bury them.
they must do this to make the land pure.
the common people will bury the enemy soldiers, and the people will become famous on the day that i bring honor to myself.” the lord god said those things.
“workers will be given a full-time job burying the dead soldiers to make the land pure.
the workers will work for seven months.
they will go around looking for dead bodies.
they will go around looking, and if anyone sees a bone, a marker will be put up by it.
the sign will stay there until the gravediggers come and bury the bone in the valley of gog’s army.
the city of the dead will be named hamonah.
in this way they will make the country pure.” 
this is what the lord god said: “son of man, speak to all the birds and wild animals for me.
tell them, ‘come here!
come here!
gather around.
come eat this sacrifice i am preparing for you.
there will be a very big sacrifice on the mountains of israel.
come, eat the meat and drink the blood.
you will eat the meat from the bodies of powerful soldiers and drink the blood from world leaders.
they will be like rams, lambs, goats, and fat bulls from bashan.
you can eat all the fat you want and drink blood until you are full.
you will eat and drink from my sacrifice, which i will kill for you.
you will have plenty of meat to eat at my table.
there will be horses and chariot drivers, powerful soldiers, and all the other fighting men.’” this is what the lord god said.
“i will let the other nations see what i have done, and they will begin to respect me!
they will see my power that i used against the enemy.
then from that day on, the family of israel will know that i am the lord their god.
and the nations will know why the family of israel was carried away as prisoners to other countries.
they will learn that my people turned against me, so i turned away from them.
i let their enemies defeat them, so my people were killed in battle.
they sinned and made themselves filthy, so i punished them for the things they did.
i turned away from them and refused to help them.” 
so this is what the lord god says: “now i will bring the family of jacob back from captivity.
i will have mercy on the whole family of israel.
i will show my strong feelings for my holy name.
the people will forget their shame and all the times they turned against me.
they will live in safety on their own land.
no one will make them afraid.
i will bring my people back from other countries.
i will gather them from the lands of their enemies.
then many nations will see how holy i am.
they will know that i am the lord their god.
that is because i made them leave their homes and go as prisoners to other countries.
but then i gathered them together again and brought them back to their own land.
i will pour out my spirit on the family of israel, and i will never turn away from my people again.” this is what the lord god said.

the lord sent nathan to david.
nathan went to him and said, “there were two men in a city.
one man was rich, but the other man was poor.
the rich man had lots of sheep and cattle.
but the poor man had nothing except one little female lamb that he bought.
the poor man fed the lamb, and the lamb grew up with this poor man and his children.
she ate from the poor man’s food and drank from his cup.
the lamb slept on the poor man’s chest.
the lamb was like a daughter to the poor man.
“then a traveler stopped to visit the rich man.
the rich man wanted to give food to the traveler, but he did not want to take any of his own sheep or cattle to feed the traveler.
no, the rich man took the lamb from the poor man and cooked it for his visitor.” 
david became very angry with the rich man.
he said to nathan, “as the lord lives, the man who did this should die!
he must pay four times the price of the lamb because he did this terrible thing and because he had no mercy.” 
then nathan said to david, “you are that rich man!
this is what the lord, the god of israel, says: ‘i chose you to be the king of israel.
i saved you from saul.
i let you take his family and his wives, and i made you king of israel and judah.
as if that had not been enough, i would have given you more and more.
so why did you ignore my command?
why did you do what i say is wrong?
you let the ammonites kill uriah the hittite, and you took his wife.
it is as if you yourself killed uriah in war.
so your family will never have peace!
when you took uriah’s wife, you showed that you did not respect me.’ 
“this is what the lord says: ‘i am bringing trouble against you.
this trouble will come from your own family.
i will take your wives from you and give them to someone who is very close to you.
he will have sexual relations with your wives, and everyone will know it!
you had sexual relations with bathsheba in secret, but i will punish you so that all the people of israel can see it.’” 
then david said to nathan, “i have sinned against the lord.” nathan said to david, “the lord will forgive you, even for this sin.
you will not die.
but you did things that made the lord’s enemies lose their respect for him, so your new baby son will die.” 
then nathan went home.
and the lord caused the baby boy who was born to david and uriah’s wife to become very sick.
david prayed to god for the baby.
david refused to eat or drink.
he went into his house and stayed there and lay on the ground all night.
the leaders of david’s family came and tried to pull david up from the ground, but he refused to get up.
he refused to eat with these leaders.
on the seventh day the baby died.
david’s servants were afraid to tell him that the baby was dead.
they said, “look, we tried to talk to david while the baby was alive, but he refused to listen to us.
if we tell david that the baby is dead, he might do something bad to himself.” 
david saw his servants whispering and understood that the baby was dead.
so david asked his servants, “is the baby dead?” the servants answered, “yes, he is dead.” 
then david got up from the floor.
he washed himself.
he changed his clothes and got dressed.
then he went into the lord’s house to worship.
after that he went home and asked for something to eat.
his servants gave him some food, and he ate.
david’s servants asked him, “why are you doing this?
when the baby was alive, you cried and refused to eat.
but when the baby died you got up and ate food.” 
david said, “while the baby was still living, i cried and refused to eat because i thought, ‘who knows?
maybe the lord will feel sorry for me and let the baby live.’ 
but now the baby is dead, so why should i refuse to eat?
can i bring the baby back to life?
some day i will go to him, but he cannot come back to me.” 
then david comforted bathsheba his wife.
he slept with her and had sexual relations with her.
bathsheba became pregnant again and had another son.
david named the boy solomon.
the lord loved solomon 
and sent word for nathan the prophet to give solomon the name jedidiah.
so nathan did this for the lord.
rabbah was the capital city of the ammonites.
joab fought against rabbah and captured it.
joab sent messengers to david and said, “i have fought against rabbah and have captured its water supply.
now bring the rest of the army together and attack rabbah.
capture this city before i do, or else it will be called by my name.” 
so david gathered all the soldiers together and went to rabbah.
he fought against rabbah and captured the city.
david took the crown off their king’s head.
the crown was gold and weighed about 75 pounds.
this crown had precious stones in it.
they put the crown on david’s head.
david took many valuable things out of the city.
david also brought out the people of the city of rabbah and made them work with saws, iron picks, and axes.
he also forced them to build things with bricks.
he did the same thing to all the ammonite cities.
then david and the army went back to jerusalem.
1 samuel.
chapter 3.
the boy samuel was eli’s helper and served the lord with him.
at that time the lord did not speak directly to people very often.
there were very few visions.
eli’s eyes were getting so weak that he was almost blind.
one night he went to his room to go to bed.
the special lamp in the lord’s temple was still burning, so samuel lay down in the temple near where the holy box was.
the lord called samuel, and samuel answered, “here i am.” 
samuel thought eli was calling him, so he ran to eli and said, “here i am.
you called me.” but eli said, “i didn’t call you.
go back to bed.” so samuel went back to bed.
again the lord called, “samuel!” again samuel ran to eli and said, “here i am.
you called me.” eli said, “i didn’t call you.
go back to bed.” 
samuel did not yet know the lord because the lord had not spoken directly to him before.
the lord called samuel the third time.
again samuel got up and went to eli and said, “here i am.
you called me.” finally, eli understood that the lord was calling the boy.
eli told samuel, “go to bed.
if he calls you again, say, ‘speak, lord.
i am your servant, and i am listening.’” so samuel went back to bed.
the lord came and stood there.
he called as he did before, saying, “samuel, samuel!” samuel said, “speak.
i am your servant, and i am listening.” 
the lord said to samuel, “i will soon do things in israel that will shock anyone who hears about them.
i will do everything i said i would do against eli and his family, everything from the beginning to the end.
i told eli i would punish his family forever.
i will do this because eli knew his sons were saying and doing bad things against god.
but he failed to control them.
that is why i swore an oath that sacrifices and offerings will never take away the sins of the people in eli’s family.” 
samuel lay down in bed until the morning came.
he got up early and opened the doors of the lord’s house.
samuel was afraid to tell eli about the vision.
but eli said to samuel, “samuel, my son.” samuel answered, “yes, sir.” 
eli asked, “what did god say to you?
don’t hide it from me.
god will punish you if you hide anything from the message he spoke to you.” 
so samuel told eli everything.
he did not hide anything from him.
eli said, “he is the lord.
let him do whatever he thinks is right.” 
the lord was with samuel while he grew up.
he did not let any of samuel’s messages prove false.
then all israel, from dan to beersheba, knew that samuel was a true prophet of the lord.
and the lord continued to appear to samuel at shiloh.
there he told samuel what he wanted.
chapter 22.
to the director: to the tune “the deer of dawn.” a song of david.
my god, my god, why have you left me?
you seem too far away to save me, too far to hear my cries for help!
my god, i kept calling by day, and i was not silent at night.
but you did not answer me.
god, you are the holy one.
you sit as king upon the praises of israel.
our ancestors trusted you.
yes, they trusted you, and you saved them.
they called to you for help and escaped their enemies.
they trusted you and were not disappointed!
but i feel like a worm, less than human!
people insult me and look down on me.
everyone who sees me makes fun of me.
they shake their heads and stick out their tongues at me.
they say, “call to the lord for help.
maybe he will save you.
if he likes you so much, surely he will rescue you!” 
god, the truth is, you are the one who brought me into this world.
you made me feel safe while i was still at my mother’s breasts.
you have been my god since the day i was born.
i was thrown into your arms as i came from my mother’s womb.
so don’t leave me!
trouble is near, and there is no one to help me.
my enemies surround me like angry bulls.
they are like the powerful bulls of bashan, and they are all around me.
their mouths are opened wide, like a lion roaring and tearing at its prey.
my strength is gone, like water poured out on the ground.
my bones have separated.
my courage is gone.
my mouth is as dry as a piece of baked pottery.
my tongue is sticking to the roof of my mouth.
you have left me dying in the dust.
the “dogs” are all around me— a pack of evil people has trapped me.
they have pierced my hands and feet.
i can see each one of my bones.
my enemies are looking at me; they just keep staring.
they divide my clothes among themselves, and they throw lots for what i am wearing.
lord, don’t leave me!
you are my strength—hurry and help me!
save me from the sword.
save my precious life from these dogs.
rescue me from the lion’s mouth.
protect me from the horns of the bulls.
i will tell my people about you.
i will praise you in the great assembly.
praise the lord, all you who worship him!
honor him, you descendants of jacob!
fear and respect him, all you people of israel!
he does not ignore those who need help.
he does not hate them.
he does not turn away from them.
he listens when they cry for help.
lord, because of you i offer praise in the great assembly.
in front of all these worshipers i will do all that i promised.
poor people, come eat and be satisfied.
you who have come looking for the lord, praise him!
may your hearts be happy forever.
may those in faraway countries remember the lord and come back to him.
may those in distant lands worship him, 
because the lord is the king.
he rules all nations.
the people have eaten all they wanted and bowed down to worship him.
yes, everyone will bow down to him— all who are on the way to the grave, unable to hold on to life.
our descendants will serve him.
those who are not yet born will be told about him.
each generation will tell their children about the good things the lord has done.
chapter 6.
oh, look at the people enjoying life in zion, and those on mount samaria who feel so safe.
they are such important leaders of a most important nation.
the “house of israel” comes to you for advice.
go look at calneh.
from there, go to the large city hamath.
go to the philistine city of gath.
are you better than these kingdoms?
their countries are larger than yours.
you people are rushing toward the day of punishment.
you bring near the rule of violence.
but now you lie on ivory beds and stretch out on your couches.
you eat tender young lambs from the flock and young calves from the stable.
you play your harps, and like david, you practice on your musical instruments.
you drink wine in fancy cups.
you use the best perfumes.
and it doesn’t even bother you that joseph’s family is being destroyed.
you people are stretched out on your couches now, but your good times will end.
you will be taken away as prisoners to a foreign country, and you will be some of the first people taken.
the lord god used his own name and made an oath.
the lord god all-powerful said, “i hate what jacob is proud of.
i hate his strong towers.
so i will let an enemy take the city and everything in it.” 
at that time ten people in one house might survive, but they too will die.
and when someone dies, a relative will come to get the body so that it can be taken out and burned.
relatives will come to take away the bones.
they will call to anyone who might be hiding back in the house, “are there any other dead bodies in there with you?” that person will answer, “no, ….” but the relative will interrupt and say, “hush!
we must not mention the name of the lord.” 
look, the lord will give the command, and the large houses will be broken to pieces, and the small houses will be broken to small pieces.
do horses run over loose rocks?
no, and people don’t use cows for plowing.
but you turned everything upside down.
you changed justice and goodness to bitter poison.
you are so excited about defeating lo debar.
and you boast, “we have taken karnaim by our own strength.” 
“but israel, i will bring a nation against you that will bring troubles to your whole country from lebo hamath to arabah brook.” this is what the lord god all-powerful said.
chapter 150.
praise the lord!
praise god in his temple!
praise him in heaven, his strong fortress!
praise him for the great things he does!
praise him for all his greatness!
praise him with trumpets and horns!
praise him with harps and lyres!
praise him with tambourines and dancing!
praise him with stringed instruments and flutes!
praise him with loud cymbals!
praise him with crashing cymbals!
everything that breathes, praise the lord!
praise the lord!
chapter 21.
so the word of the lord came to me again.
he said, 
“son of man, look toward jerusalem and speak against their holy places.
speak against the land of israel for me.
say to the land of israel, ‘this is what the lord said: i am against you!
i will pull my sword from its sheath.
i will remove all people from you—the good and the evil.
i will cut off both good people and evil people from you.
i will pull my sword from its sheath and use it against all people from south to north.
then everyone will know that i am the lord.
they will know that i have pulled my sword from its sheath.
my sword will not go back into its sheath again until it is finished.’ 
“son of man, make sad sounds like a sad person with a broken heart.
make these sad sounds in front of the people.
then they will ask you, ‘why are you making these sad sounds?’ then you must say, ‘because of the sad news that is coming.
every heart will melt with fear.
all hands will become weak.
every spirit will become weak.
all knees will be like water.’ look, that bad news is coming.
these things will happen!” this is what the lord god said.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, speak to the people for me.
say this, ‘this is what the lord says: “‘look, a sword, a sharp sword, and it has been polished.
the sword was made sharp for killing.
it was polished to flash like lightning.
my son, you ran away from the stick i used to punish you.
you refused to be punished with that wooden stick.
so the sword has been polished.
now it can be used.
the sword was sharpened and polished.
now it can be put in the hand of the killer.
“‘son of man, shout out and scream because the sword will be used against my people and all the rulers of israel.
they wanted war—so they will be with my people when the sword comes.
so slap your thigh to show your sadness, 
because it is not just a test.
you refused to be punished with the wooden stick, so what else should i use to punish you?
a sword?’” this is what the lord god said.
“son of man, clap your hands to show your sadness, and speak to the people for me.
let the sword come down twice, no, three times!
this sword is for killing the people.
this is the sword for the great killing.
this sword will cut into them.
their hearts will melt with fear, and many people will fall.
the sword will kill many people by the city gates.
yes, the sword will flash like lightning.
it was polished to kill the people!
sword, be sharp!
cut on the right side.
cut straight ahead.
cut on the left side.
go wherever your edge was chosen to go.
“then i, too, will clap my hands and stop showing my anger.
i, the lord, have spoken!” 
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, draw two roads that the sword of the king of babylon can use to come to israel.
both roads will come from the same country.
then draw a sign at the head of the road to the city.
use the sign to show which road the sword will use.
one road leads to the ammonite city of rabbah.
the other road leads to judah, to the protected city, jerusalem.
the king of babylon has come to where the two roads separate.
he uses magic to learn which way to go: he shakes his arrows, he asks his family idols, and he looks at the liver from an animal he has killed.
“the signs tell him to take the road on his right, the road leading to jerusalem, where he will use battering rams.
the signs tell him to give the command for his soldiers to begin the killing.
they will shout the battle cry and set the battering rams against the gates.
they will build a wall of dirt around the city and a dirt road leading up to the walls.
they will build wooden towers to attack the city.
but the people in jerusalem will think this is all a big mistake.
they will not believe that this could happen, because they had made a peace agreement with babylon’s king.
but the king will remind them that they are guilty of breaking that agreement, and he will take them captive.” 
this is what the lord god says: “you have done many evil things.
your sins are very clear.
you forced me to remember that you are guilty, so the enemy will catch you in his hand.
and you, evil leader of israel, you will be killed.
your time of punishment has come!
the end is here!” 
this is what the lord god says: “take off the turban!
take off the crown!
the time has come to change.
the important leaders will be brought low, and those who are not important now will become important leaders.
i will completely destroy that city!
but this will not happen until the right man becomes the new king.
then i will let him have this city.” 
“son of man, speak to the people for me.
say this, ‘this is what the lord god says to the people of ammon and their shameful god: “‘look, a sword!
the sword is out of its sheath.
it has been polished.
the sword is ready to kill.
it was polished to flash like lightning!
“‘your visions are useless.
your magic will not help you.
it is only a bunch of lies.
the sword is now at the throats of evil men.
they will soon be only dead bodies.
their time has come.
the time has come for their evil to end.
“‘put the sword back in its sheath.
babylon, i will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land where you were born.
i will pour out my anger against you.
my anger will burn you like a hot wind.
i will hand you over to cruel men.
those men are skilled at killing people.
you will be like fuel for the fire.
your blood will flow deep into the earth—people will never remember you again.
i, the lord, have spoken!’” 
2 kings.
chapter 5.
naaman was the captain of the army of the king of aram.
he was very important to his king because the lord used him to lead aram to victory.
naaman was a great and powerful man, but he was also sick with leprosy.
the aramean army sent many groups of soldiers to fight in israel.
one time they took a little girl from the land of israel.
this girl became a servant of naaman’s wife.
she said to his wife, “i wish that my master would meet the prophet who lives in samaria.
he could heal naaman of his leprosy.” 
naaman went to the king and told him what the israelite girl said.
then the king of aram said, “go now, and i will send a letter to the king of israel.” so naaman went to israel.
he took 750 pounds of silver, 6000 pieces of gold and ten changes of clothes as gifts.
naaman took the letter from the king of aram to the king of israel.
the letter said: “now this letter is to show that i am sending my servant naaman to you.
cure his leprosy.” 
when the king of israel had read the letter, he tore his clothes to show he was sad and upset.
he said, “am i god?
i don’t have the power over life and death.
so why did the king of aram send a man sick with leprosy for me to heal?
think about it, and you will see that it is a trick.
the king of aram is trying to start a fight.” 
elisha, the man of god, heard that the king of israel had torn his clothes.
so elisha sent this message to the king: “why did you tear your clothes?
let naaman come to me.
then he will know there is a prophet in israel.” 
so naaman came with his horses and chariots to elisha’s house and stood outside the door.
elisha sent a messenger to naaman who said, “go and wash in the jordan river seven times.
then your skin will be healed, and you will be pure and clean.” 
naaman became angry and left.
he said, “i thought elisha would at least come out and stand in front of me and call on the name of the lord his god.
i thought he would wave his hand over my body and heal the leprosy.
abana and pharpar, the rivers of damascus, are better than all the water in israel.
why can’t i wash in those rivers in damascus and become clean?” he was very angry and turned to leave.
but naaman’s servants went to him and talked to him.
they said, “father, if the prophet told you to do some great thing, you would do it, isn’t that right?
but he said, ‘wash, and you will be pure and clean.’” 
so naaman did what the man of god said.
he went down and dipped himself in the jordan river seven times, and he became pure and clean.
his skin became soft like the skin of a baby.
naaman and his whole group came back to the man of god.
he stood before elisha and said, “look, i now know there is no god in all the earth except in israel.
now please accept a gift from me.” 
but elisha said, “the lord is the one i serve, and as surely as he lives, i will not accept any gift.” naaman tried hard to make elisha take the gift, but he refused.
then naaman said, “if you will not accept this gift, at least do this for me.
let me have enough dirt from israel to fill the baskets on two of my mules.
i ask this because i will never again offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other gods.
i will offer sacrifices only to the lord!
and i pray that the lord will forgive me for this: when my master goes to the temple of rimmon to worship that false god, he will want to lean on me for support.
so i must bow down in the temple of rimmon.
i ask the lord now to forgive me when that happens.” 
then elisha said to naaman, “go in peace.” so naaman left elisha and went a short way.
but gehazi, the servant of elisha the man of god, said, “look, my master has let naaman the aramean go without accepting the gift that he brought.
as the lord lives, i will run after naaman and get something from him.” 
so gehazi ran to naaman.
naaman saw someone running after him.
he stepped down from the chariot to meet gehazi.
naaman said, “is everything all right?” 
gehazi said, “yes, everything is all right.
my master has sent me.
he said, ‘look, two young men came to me from the group of prophets in the hill country of ephraim.
please give them 75 pounds of silver and two changes of clothes.’” 
naaman said, “please, take 150 pounds.” he persuaded gehazi to take the silver.
naaman put 150 pounds of silver in two bags and took two changes of clothes.
then he gave these things to two of his servants.
the servants carried these things for gehazi.
when gehazi came to the hill, he took these things from the servants.
he sent the servants away, and they left.
then he hid those things in the house.
gehazi came in and stood before his master.
elisha said to gehazi, “where have you been gehazi?” gehazi answered, “i didn’t go anywhere.” 
elisha said to him, “that is not true!
my heart was with you when the man turned from his chariot to meet you.
this is not the time to take money, clothes, olives, grapes, sheep, cattle, or men and women servants.
now you and your children will catch naaman’s disease.
you will have leprosy forever!” when gehazi left elisha, his skin was as white as snow!
he was sick with leprosy.
1 samuel.
chapter 4.
then samuel would announce the lord’s message to all the people of israel.
when eli was very old, his sons lived more and more in a way the lord considered evil.
at that time the israelites went out to fight against the philistines.
the israelites made their camp at ebenezer.
the philistines made their camp at aphek.
the philistines lined up their soldiers in front of the israelites and began the attack.
the philistines defeated the israelites.
they killed about 4000 soldiers from israel’s army.
the rest of the israelite soldiers went back to their camp.
the elders of israel asked, “why did the lord let the philistines defeat us?
let’s bring the lord’s box of the agreement from shiloh.
god will go with us into battle and save us from our enemies.” 
so the people sent men to shiloh.
the men brought back the lord all-powerful’s box of the agreement.
on top of the box are the cherub angels.
they are like a throne where the lord sits.
eli’s two sons, hophni and phinehas, came with the box.
when the lord’s box of the agreement came into the camp, all the israelites gave a great shout loud enough to make the ground shake.
the philistines heard israel’s shout and asked, “why are the people so excited in the hebrew camp?” then the philistines learned that the lord’s holy box had been brought into israel’s camp.
they became afraid and said, “gods have come to their camp!
we’re in trouble.
this has never happened before.
we are worried.
who can save us from these powerful gods?
these gods are the same ones that gave the egyptians those diseases and terrible sicknesses.
be brave, philistines.
fight like men.
in the past they were our slaves, so fight like men or you will become their slaves.” 
so the philistines fought very hard and defeated the israelites.
the israelite soldiers ran away and went home.
it was a terrible defeat for israel.
30,000 israelite soldiers were killed.
the philistines took god’s holy box and killed eli’s two sons, hophni and phinehas.
one of the men who ran from the battle was a man from the tribe of benjamin.
he tore his clothes and put dust on his head to show his great sadness.
eli was worried about the holy box, so he was sitting there by the city gate waiting and watching when the benjamite man came into shiloh and told the bad news.
all the people in town began to cry loudly.
eli was 98 years old.
he was blind, so he could not see what was happening, but he could hear the loud noise of the people crying.
eli asked, “why are the people making this loud noise?” the benjamite man ran to eli and told him what happened.
he said, “i am the man who just came from the battle.
i ran away from the battle today.” eli asked, “what happened, son?” 
the benjamite man answered, “israel ran away from the philistines.
the israelite army has lost many soldiers.
your two sons are both dead, and the philistines took god’s holy box.” 
when the benjamite man mentioned god’s holy box, eli fell backward off his chair near the gate and broke his neck.
eli was old and fat, so he died.
he had led israel for 20 years.
eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of phinehas, was pregnant.
it was nearly time for her baby to be born.
she heard the news that god’s holy box was taken.
she also heard that her father-in-law eli and her husband phinehas were both dead.
as soon as she heard the news, her pain started and she began giving birth to her baby.
she was about to die when the women who were helping her said, “don’t worry, you have given birth to a son.” but she did not answer or pay attention.
she named the baby ichabod, that is to say, “israel’s glory has been taken away.” she did this because god’s holy box was taken away and because both her father-in-law and her husband were dead.
she said, “israel’s glory has been taken away” because the philistines had taken god’s holy box.
chapter 32.
on the first day of the twelfth month in the twelfth year of exile, the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, sing this sad song about pharaoh, king of egypt.
say to him: “‘you thought you were like a powerful young lion walking proud among the nations.
but really, you are like a dragon in the lakes.
you push your way through the streams.
you make the water muddy with your feet and stir up the rivers of egypt.’” 
this is what the lord god says: “i have gathered many people together.
now i will throw my net over you.
then those people will pull you in.
then i will drop you on the dry ground.
i will throw you down in the field.
i will let all the birds come and eat you.
i will let wild animals from every place come and eat you until they are full.
i will scatter your body on the mountains.
i will fill the valleys with your dead body.
i will pour your blood on the mountains, and it will soak down into the ground.
the rivers will be full of you.
i will make you disappear.
i will cover the sky and make the stars dark.
i will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not shine.
i will darken the lights in the sky over you.
i will make your whole country dark.” this is what the lord god said.
“i will make many people sad and upset when i bring an enemy to destroy you.
nations you don’t even know will be upset.
i will make many people shocked about you.
their kings will be terrified of you, when i swing my sword before them.
they will shake with fear on the day you fall.
each king will be afraid for his own life.” 
that will happen because of what the lord god said: “the sword of the king of babylon will come to fight against you.
i will use those soldiers to kill your people in battle.
they come from the most terrible of the nations.
they will destroy the things egypt is proud of.
the people of egypt will be destroyed.
there are many animals by the rivers in egypt.
i will also destroy all those animals.
people will not make the waters muddy with their feet anymore.
the hoofs of cattle will not make the water muddy anymore.
so i will make the water in egypt calm.
i will cause their rivers to run slowly—they will be slick like oil.” this is what the lord god said.
“i will make the land of egypt empty.
that land will lose everything.
i will punish all the people living in egypt.
then they will know that i am the lord!
“this is a sad song that people will sing for egypt.
the daughters in other nations will sing this sad song.
they will sing it as a sad song about egypt and all its people.” this is what the lord god said.
on the fifteenth day of that month in the twelfth year of exile, the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, cry for the people of egypt.
lead egypt and the daughters from powerful nations to the grave.
lead them to the world below where they will be with the other people who went down into that deep hole.
“egypt, you are no better than anyone else!
go down to the place of death.
go lie down with those foreigners.
“egypt will go to be with all the other men who were killed in battle.
the enemy has pulled her and all her people away.
“strong and powerful men were killed in battle.
those foreigners went down to the place of death.
and from that place, those who were killed will speak to egypt and his helpers.
“assyria and all its army are there in the place of death.
their graves are deep down in that deep hole.
all the assyrian soldiers were killed in battle, and their graves are all around his grave.
when they were alive, they made people afraid, but they were all killed in battle.
“elam is there and all its army is around her grave.
all of them were killed in battle.
those foreigners went deep down into the ground.
when they were alive, they made people afraid.
but they carried their shame with them down to that deep hole.
they have made a bed for elam and all its soldiers who were killed in battle.
elam’s army is all around its grave.
all those foreigners were killed in battle.
when they were alive, they scared people.
but they carried their shame with them down into that deep hole.
they were put with all the other people who were killed.
“meshech, tubal, and all their armies are there.
their graves are around it.
all those foreigners were killed in battle.
when they were alive, they made people afraid.
but now they are lying down by the powerful men who died long, long ago!
they were buried with their weapons of war.
their swords will be laid under their heads.
but their sins are on their bones, because when they were alive, they scared people.
“egypt, you also will be destroyed, and you will lie down by those foreigners.
you will lie with the other soldiers who were killed in battle.
“edom is there also.
his kings and other leaders are there with him.
they were powerful soldiers, but now they lie with the other men who were killed in battle.
they are lying there with those foreigners.
they are there with the other people who went down into that deep hole.
“the rulers from the north are there, all of them, and there are all the soldiers from sidon.
their strength scared people, but they are embarrassed.
those foreigners lie there with the other men who were killed in battle.
they carried their shame with them down into that deep hole.
“yes, pharaoh and all his army will be killed in battle.
pharaoh will be comforted when he sees his many men and all the others who went down into the place of death.” this is what the lord god said.
“people were afraid of pharaoh when he was alive, but he will lie down next to those foreigners.
pharaoh and his army will lie down with all the other soldiers who were killed in battle.” this is what the lord god said.
chapter 139.
to the director: a praise song of david.
lord, you have tested me, so you know all about me.
you know when i sit down and when i get up.
you know my thoughts from far away.
you know where i go and where i lie down.
you know everything i do.
lord, you know what i want to say, even before the words leave my mouth.
you are all around me—in front of me and behind me.
i feel your hand on my shoulder.
i am amazed at what you know; it is too much for me to understand.
your spirit is everywhere i go.
i cannot escape your presence.
if i go up to heaven, you will be there.
if i go down to the place of death, you will be there.
if i go east where the sun rises or go to live in the west beyond the sea, 
even there you will take my hand and lead me.
your strong right hand will protect me.
suppose i wanted to hide from you and said, “surely the darkness will hide me.
the day will change to night and cover me.” 
even the darkness is not dark to you.
the night is as bright as the day.
darkness and light are the same.
you formed the way i think and feel.
you put me together in my mother’s womb.
i praise you because you made me in such a wonderful way.
i know how amazing that was!
you could see my bones grow as my body took shape, hidden in my mother’s womb.
you could see my body grow each passing day.
you listed all my parts, and not one of them was missing.
your thoughts are beyond my understanding.
they cannot be measured!
if i could count them, they would be more than all the grains of sand.
but when i finished, i would have just begun.
you murderers, get away from me!
god, kill those wicked people— 
those who say bad things about you.
your enemies use your name falsely.
lord, i hate those who hate you.
i hate those who are against you.
i hate them completely!
your enemies are also my enemies.
god, examine me and know my mind.
test me and know all my worries.
make sure that i am not going the wrong way.
lead me on the path that has always been right.
chapter 11.
then zophar from naamah answered job and said, 
“this flood of words should be answered!
does all this talking make job right?
do you think we don’t have an answer for you?
do you think no one will warn you when you laugh at god?
you say to god, ‘my arguments are right, and you can see i am pure.’ 
i wish god would answer you and tell you that you are wrong.
he could tell you the secret of wisdom.
he would tell you that every story has two sides.
you can be sure of this: god is not punishing you as much as he should.
“do you think you really understand god?
do you completely understand god all-powerful?
that knowledge is higher than the heavens and deeper than the place of death.
so what can you do?
how can you learn it all?
it is greater than the earth and bigger than the seas.
“if god decides to arrest you and take you to court, no one could stop him.
god knows who is worthless.
when he sees evil, he remembers it.
a wild donkey cannot give birth to a man, and a stupid person will never become wise.
prepare your heart to serve only god.
lift your arms and pray to him.
put away the sin that you still hold on to.
don’t keep evil in your tent.
if you will do that, you could look to god without shame.
you can stand strong and not be afraid.
then you can forget your troubles, like water that has already passed by.
your life will be brighter than the sunshine at noon.
life’s darkest hours will shine like the morning sun.
you will feel safe because there is hope.
god will protect you and give you rest.
you will lie down without fear of anyone.
many people will come to you for help.
evil people might look for help, but they will not escape their troubles.
their hope leads only to death.” 
genesis.
chapter 12.
the lord said to abram, “leave your country and your people.
leave your father’s family and go to the country that i will show you.
i will build a great nation from you.
i will bless you and make your name famous.
people will use your name to bless other people.
i will bless those who bless you, and i will curse those who curse you.
i will use you to bless all the people on earth.” 
so abram left haran just like the lord said, and lot went with him.
abram was 75 years old when he left haran.
he took his wife sarai, his nephew lot, all the slaves, and all the other things he had gotten in haran.
then he and his group moved to the land of canaan.
abram traveled through the land as far as the town of shechem and then to the big tree at moreh.
the canaanites were living in the land at that time.
the lord appeared to abram and said, “i will give this land to your descendants.” abram built an altar to honor the lord who appeared to him there.
then he left that place and traveled to the mountains east of bethel.
he set up his tent there.
bethel was to the west, and ai was to the east.
abram built another altar at that place to honor the lord, and he worshiped the lord there.
then he moved on toward the negev, stopping for a time at several places on the way.
during this time there was not enough food in the land, so abram went down to egypt to live.
just before they arrived in egypt, abram told sarai, “look, i know that you are a very beautiful woman.
when the egyptian men see you, they will say, ‘this woman is his wife.’ then they will kill me and keep you alive because they want you.
so tell them that you are my sister.
then they will be good to me because of you.
in this way you will save my life.” 
so when abram went into egypt, the egyptian men saw that sarai was a very beautiful woman.
even some of pharaoh’s officials noticed her and told pharaoh how beautiful she was.
so they took her to pharaoh’s house.
pharaoh was kind to abram because he thought abram was sarai’s brother.
he gave abram sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and men and women servants.
pharaoh took abram’s wife, so the lord caused pharaoh and all the people in his house to have very bad diseases.
pharaoh called abram and said to him, “you have done a very bad thing to me!
why didn’t you tell me sarai was your wife?
you said, ‘she is my sister.’ why did you say that?
i took her so that she could be my wife, but now i give your wife back to you.
take her and go!” 
then pharaoh commanded his men to lead abram out of egypt.
so abram and his wife left that place and took everything they had with them.
chapter 2.
while jonah was in the stomach of the fish, he prayed to the lord his god.
he said, 
“i was in very bad trouble.
i called to the lord for help, and he answered me.
i was deep in the grave.
i cried to you, and you heard my voice.
“you threw me into the sea.
your powerful waves splashed over me.
i went down, down into the deep sea.
the water was all around me.
then i thought, ‘now i must go where you cannot see me,’ but i continued looking to your holy temple for help.
“the seawater closed over me.
the water covered my mouth, and i could not breathe.
i went down, down into the deep sea.
seaweed wrapped around my head.
i was at the bottom of the sea, the place where the mountains begin.
i thought i was locked in this prison forever, but the lord my god took me out of my grave.
god, you gave me life again!
“my soul gave up all hope, but then i remembered the lord.
i prayed to you, and you heard my prayers in your holy temple.
“some people worship useless idols, but those statues never help them.
i will give sacrifices to you, and i will praise and thank you.
i will make special promises to you, and i will do what i promise.” salvation only comes from the lord!
then the lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited jonah out of its stomach onto the dry land.
chapter 11.
“so you must love the lord your god.
you must do what he tells you to do and always obey his laws, rules, and commands.
remember today all the great things the lord your god has done to teach you.
it was you, not your children, who saw those things happen and lived through them.
you saw how great he is.
you saw how strong he is, and you saw the powerful things he does.
you, not your children, saw the miracles he did in egypt.
you saw what he did to pharaoh, the king of egypt, and to his whole country.
you, not your children, saw what he did to the egyptian army—to their horses and chariots.
they were chasing you, but you saw him cover them with the water from the red sea.
you saw how the lord completely destroyed them.
it was you, not your children, who saw everything he did for you in the desert until you came to this place.
you saw what he did to dathan and abiram, the sons of eliab from reuben’s family.
all the israelites watched as the ground opened up like a mouth and swallowed them, their families, their tents, and all of their servants and animals.
it was you, not your children, who saw all the great things the lord did.
“so you must obey every command i tell you today.
then you will be strong.
and you will be able to go across the jordan river and take the land that you are ready to enter.
then you will live a long life in that country.
the lord promised to give that land to your ancestors and all their descendants.
it is a land filled with many good things.
the land that you will get is not like the land of egypt that you came from.
in egypt you planted your seeds and used your feet to pump water from the canals to water your fields like a vegetable garden.
but the land that you will soon get is not like that.
in israel there are mountains and valleys, and the land gets its water from the rain that falls from the sky.
the lord your god cares for that land.
the lord your god watches over it, from the beginning to the end of the year.
“the lord says, ‘you must listen carefully to the commands i give you today: you must love the lord your god, and serve him with all your heart and all your soul.
if you do that, 
i will send rain for your land at the right time.
i will send the autumn rain and the spring rain.
then you can gather your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
and i will make grass grow in your fields for your cattle.
you will have plenty to eat.’ 
“he says, ‘be careful!
don’t be fooled.
don’t turn away from me to serve other gods and to bow down to them.’ 
if you do that, the lord will become very angry with you.
he will shut the skies, and there will be no rain.
the land will not make a harvest, and you will soon die in the good land that the lord is giving you.
“remember these commands i give you.
keep them in your hearts.
write them down and tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads as a way to remember my laws.
teach these laws to your children.
talk about these things when you sit in your houses, when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.
write these commands on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.
then both you and your children will live a long time in the land that the lord promised to give to your ancestors.
you will live there as long as the skies are above the earth.
“be careful to obey every command i have told you to follow: love the lord your god, follow all his ways, and be faithful to him.
then, when you go into the land, the lord will force all those other nations out.
you will take the land from nations that are larger and more powerful than you.
all the land you walk on will be yours.
your land will go from the desert in the south all the way to lebanon in the north.
it will go from the euphrates river in the east all the way to the mediterranean sea.
no one will be able to stand against you.
the lord your god will make the people fear you wherever you go in that land.
that is what he promised you before.
“today i am giving you a choice.
you may choose the blessing or the curse.
you will get the blessing if you listen and obey the commands of the lord your god that i have told you today.
but you will get the curse if you refuse to listen and obey the commands of the lord your god.
so don’t stop living the way i command you today, and don’t follow other gods that you don’t know.
“the lord your god will lead you to your land.
you will soon go in and take that land.
at that time you must go to the top of mount gerizim and read the blessings to the people from there.
and then you must go to the top of mount ebal and read the curses to the people from there.
these mountains are on the other side of the jordan river in the land of the canaanites living in the jordan valley.
these mountains are toward the west, not far from the oak trees of moreh near the town of gilgal.
you will go across the jordan river.
you will take the land that the lord your god is giving you.
this land will belong to you.
when you are living in this land, 
you must carefully obey all the laws and rules i give you today.
1 kings.
chapter 4.
king solomon ruled over all israel.
these are the names of his leading officials: azariah son of zadok was the priest; 
elihoreph and ahijah, sons of shisha, had the job of writing notes about what happened in the courts; jehoshaphat son of ahilud wrote notes about the history of the people; 
benaiah son of jehoiada was the commander of the army; zadok and abiathar were priests; 
azariah son of nathan was in charge of the district governors; zabud son of nathan was a priest and an advisor to king solomon; 
ahishar was responsible for everything in the king’s palace; adoniram son of abda was in charge of the slaves.
israel was divided into twelve districts.
solomon chose governors to rule over each district.
these governors were ordered to gather food from their districts and give it to the king and his family.
each of the twelve governors was responsible for giving food to the king one month each year.
these are the names of the twelve governors: ben hur was governor of the hill country of ephraim.
ben deker was governor of makaz, shaalbim, beth shemesh, and elon bethhanan.
ben hesed was governor of arubboth, socoh, and hepher.
ben abinadab was governor of naphoth dor.
he was married to taphath, daughter of solomon.
baana son of ahilud was governor of taanach and megiddo and all of beth shean next to zarethan.
this was below jezreel, from beth shean to abel meholah across from jokmeam.
ben geber was governor of ramoth gilead.
he was governor of all the towns and villages of jair son of manasseh in gilead.
he was also governor of the district of argob in bashan.
in this area there were 60 cities with big walls around them.
these cities also had bronze bars on the gates.
ahinadab son of iddo was governor of mahanaim.
ahimaaz was governor of naphtali.
he was married to basemath the daughter of solomon.
baana son of hushai was governor of asher and aloth.
jehoshaphat son of paruah was governor of issachar.
shimei son of ela was governor of benjamin.
geber son of uri was governor of gilead.
there had been two kings in this area, king sihon of the amorites and king og of bashan, but solomon appointed only one governor for that district.
in judah and israel there were as many people as sand on the seashore.
the people were happy and had plenty to eat and drink.
solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the euphrates river to the land of the philistines.
his kingdom went as far as the border of egypt.
these countries sent gifts to solomon, and they obeyed him all of his life.
this is the amount of food that solomon needed each day for himself and for everyone who ate at his table: 150 bushels of fine flour, 300 bushels of flour, 10 cattle that were fed grain, 20 cattle that were raised in the fields, 100 sheep, wild animals such as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and game birds.
solomon ruled over all the countries west of the euphrates river, from tiphsah to gaza.
and solomon had peace along all the borders of his kingdom.
during solomon’s life everyone in judah and israel, all the way from dan to beersheba, lived in peace and security.
the people were at peace sitting under their own fig trees and grapevines.
solomon had places to keep 4000 horses for his chariots and he had 12,000 horse soldiers.
and each month one of the twelve district governors gave king solomon everything he needed for all the people who ate at the king’s table.
the district governors also gave the king enough straw and barley for the chariot horses and the riding horses.
everyone brought this grain to the necessary places.
god made solomon very wise.
solomon could understand more than you can imagine.
he was wiser than anyone in the east or in egypt.
he was wiser than anyone on earth, even ethan the ezrahite and the sons of mahol—heman, calcol, and darda.
king solomon became famous in all the surrounding countries.
by the end of his life, he had written 3000 proverbs and 1005 songs.
solomon also knew very much about nature.
he taught about many different kinds of plants—everything from the great cedar trees of lebanon to the little vines that grow out of the walls.
he also taught about animals, birds, and snakes.
people from every nation came to listen to solomon’s wisdom.
kings all over the world sent their people to listen to him.
chapter 26.
this message came from the lord during the first year that jehoiakim son of josiah was king of judah.
the lord said, “jeremiah, stand in the temple yard of the lord.
give this message to all the people of judah who are coming to worship at the temple of the lord.
tell them everything that i tell you to speak.
don’t leave out any part of my message.
maybe they will listen and obey my message.
maybe they will stop living such evil lives.
if they change, i will change my mind about my plans to punish them.
i am planning this punishment because of the many evil things they have done.
you will say to them, ‘this is what the lord says: i gave my teachings to you.
you must obey me and follow my teachings.
you must listen to what my servants say to you.
the prophets are my servants.
i have sent my prophets to you again and again, but you did not listen to them.
if you don’t obey me, i will make my temple in jerusalem just like my holy tent at shiloh.
people all over the world will think of jerusalem when they ask for bad things to happen to other cities.’” 
the priests, the prophets, and all the people heard jeremiah say all these words at the lord’s temple.
jeremiah finished speaking everything the lord had commanded him to say to the people.
then the priests, the prophets, and all the people grabbed jeremiah.
they said, “you will die for saying such terrible things!
how dare you say such a thing in the name of the lord!
how dare you say that this temple will be destroyed like the one at shiloh!
how dare you say that jerusalem will become a desert with no one living in it!” all the people gathered around jeremiah in the temple of the lord.
now the rulers of judah heard about everything that was happening.
so they came out of the king’s palace.
they went up to the lord’s temple.
they took their places at the entrance of the new gate.
the new gate is a gate leading to the lord’s temple.
then the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and all the other people.
they said, “jeremiah should be killed.
he said bad things about jerusalem.
you heard him say those things.” 
then jeremiah spoke to all the rulers of judah and all the other people.
he said, “the lord sent me to say these things about this temple and this city.
everything that you have heard is from the lord.
you people, change your lives!
you must start doing good!
you must obey the lord your god.
if you do that, he will change his mind.
he will not do the bad things he told you about.
as for me, i am in your power.
do to me what you think is good and right.
but if you kill me, be sure of one thing.
you will be guilty of killing an innocent person.
you will make this city and everyone living in it guilty too.
the lord really did send me to you.
the message you heard really is from the lord.” 
then the rulers and all the people spoke.
they said to the priests and the prophets, “jeremiah must not be killed.
what he told us comes from the lord our god.” 
then some of the elders stood up and spoke to all the people.
they said, “micah the prophet was from the city of moresheth.
he was a prophet during the time that hezekiah was king of judah.
micah said this to all the people of judah: ‘this is what the lord all-powerful says: zion will be destroyed.
it will become a plowed field.
jerusalem will become a pile of rocks.
temple mount will be an empty hill overgrown with bushes.’ 
“king hezekiah of judah and the people of judah did not kill micah.
you know that hezekiah respected the lord and wanted to please him.
so the lord changed his mind and didn’t do the bad things to judah that he said he would do.
if we hurt jeremiah, we will bring many troubles on ourselves.
and those troubles will be our own fault.” 
in the past there was another man who spoke the lord’s message.
his name was uriah son of shemaiah from the city of kiriath jearim.
uriah said the same things against this city and this land that jeremiah did.
king jehoiakim, his army officers, and the leaders of judah heard uriah and became angry.
king jehoiakim wanted to kill uriah, but uriah heard about it.
uriah was afraid, so he escaped to the land of egypt.
but king jehoiakim sent elnathan son of acbor and some other men to egypt.
they brought uriah from egypt and took him to king jehoiakim.
jehoiakim ordered uriah to be killed with a sword.
uriah’s body was thrown into the burial place where the poor are buried.
there was an important man named ahikam son of shaphan who supported jeremiah.
he kept jeremiah from being killed by the priests and prophets.
chapter 11.
then the lord told moses, “i have one more disaster to bring against pharaoh and egypt.
after this, he will ask you to leave egypt.
in fact, he will force you to leave this country.
you must give this message to the israelites: ‘men and women, you must ask your neighbors to give you things made of silver and gold.’” 
the lord caused the egyptians to be kind to the israelites.
the egyptians, even pharaoh’s own officials, already considered moses to be a great man.
moses said to the king, “the lord says, ‘at midnight tonight, i will go through egypt, 
and every firstborn son in egypt will die, from the firstborn son of pharaoh, the ruler of egypt, to the firstborn son of the slave girl grinding grain.
even the firstborn animals will die.
the crying in egypt will be worse than at any time in the past or any time in the future.
but none of the israelites or their animals will be hurt—not even a dog will bark at them.’ then you will know that the lord has treated israel differently from egypt.
all these officials of yours will come down and bow to me.
they will say, ‘leave and take all your people with you.’ only then will i leave!” then in anger, moses left the meeting with pharaoh.
then the lord told moses, “the reason pharaoh did not listen to you is so that i could show my great power in egypt.” 
that is why moses and aaron did all these great miracles in front of pharaoh.
and that is why the lord made pharaoh so stubborn that he would not let the israelites leave his country.
chapter 31.
the lord spoke to moses and said, 
“moses, tell the israelites this: ‘go and attack the midianites, and do to them what they did to you.’ after that moses, you will die.” 
so moses spoke to the people.
he said, “choose some of your men to be soldiers.
the lord will use these men to do to the midianites what they did to you.
choose 1000 men from each of the tribes of israel.
there will be a total of 12,000 soldiers from the tribes of israel.” 
moses sent these 12,000 men to war.
he sent phineas son of eleazar with them as the priest.
phineas took the holy things and the horns and trumpets with him.
the israelites fought the midianites as the lord had commanded.
they killed all the midianite men.
among the people who they killed were evi, rekem, zur, hur, and reba—the five kings of midian.
they also killed balaam son of beor with a sword.
the israelites took the midianite women and children as prisoners.
they also took all their sheep, cattle, and other things.
then they burned all their towns and villages.
they took all the people and animals 
and brought them to moses, eleazar the priest, and all the other israelites.
they brought all the things they took in war to the camp of israel.
the israelites were camped in the jordan valley in moab, on the east side of the jordan river across from jericho.
then moses, eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the people went out of the camp to meet with the soldiers.
moses was very angry with the leaders of the army, the commanders of 1000 men, and the commanders of 100 men, who came back from the war.
moses said to them, “why did you let the women live?
these are the women who listened to balaam and caused the men of israel to turn away from the lord that time at peor.
the disease will come to the lord’s people again.
now, kill all the midianite boys, and kill all the midianite women who have had sexual relations with a man.
you can let all the young girls live—but only if they never had sexual relations with any man.
and then, all you men who killed other people must stay outside the camp for seven days.
you must stay outside the camp even if you just touched a dead body.
on the third day you and your prisoners must make yourselves pure.
you must do the same thing again on the seventh day.
you must wash all of your clothes.
you must wash anything made with leather, wool, or wood.
you must purify yourselves.” 
then eleazar the priest spoke to the soldiers.
he said, “these are the rules that the lord gave to moses for soldiers coming back from war.
you must put gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead into the fire and then wash these things with the special water to make them pure.
if something can be put in the fire, you must put it in fire to purify it.
if things cannot be put in fire, you must still wash them with the special water.
on the seventh day you must wash all of your clothes.
then you will be pure.
after that you can come into camp.” 
then the lord said to moses, 
“you, eleazar the priest, and all the leaders should count all the prisoners, animals, and everything the soldiers took in war.
then divide these things between the soldiers who went to war and the rest of the israelites.
take part of these things from the soldiers who went to war.
that part will belong to the lord.
his share is one from every 500 items.
this includes people, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
take that share from the soldiers’ half of the things they took in war.
then give these things to eleazar the priest.
that part will belong to the lord.
and then, from the people’s half, take one thing for every 50 items.
this includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, or any other animal.
give that share to the levites, because they take care of the lord’s holy tent.” 
so moses and eleazar did what the lord commanded moses.
the soldiers had taken 675,000 sheep, 
72,000 cattle, 
61,000 donkeys, 
and 32,000 women.
(these are only the women who had not had sexual relations with any man.)
the soldiers who went to war got 337,500 sheep.
they gave 675 sheep to the lord.
the soldiers got 36,000 cattle.
they gave 72 cattle to the lord.
the soldiers got 30,500 donkeys.
they gave 61 donkeys to the lord.
the soldiers got 16,000 women.
they gave 32 women to the lord.
moses gave all these gifts for the lord to eleazar the priest, as the lord had commanded him.
then moses counted the people’s half.
this was their share that moses had taken from the soldiers who had gone to war.
the people got 337,500 sheep, 
36,000 cattle, 
30,500 donkeys, 
and 16,000 women.
moses took one out of every 50 women and animals.
he gave them to the levites because they took care of the lord’s holy tent.
moses did this as the lord had commanded.
then the leaders of the army (the leaders over 1000 men and the leaders over 100 men) came to moses.
they told moses, “we, your servants, have counted our soldiers.
we have not missed any of them.
so we are bringing the lord’s gift from every soldier.
we are bringing things that are made of gold—armbands, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces.
this gift to the lord is to make us pure.” 
so moses and eleazar the priest accepted all these gold items from them.
the gold that the commanders and captains gave to the lord weighed about 424 pounds.
the soldiers kept the rest of their share of the things they took in war.
moses and eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders and captains and then put that gold in the meeting tent.
this present was a memorial before the lord for the israelites.
chapter 3.
there is a right time for everything, and everything on earth will happen at the right time.
there is a time to be born and a time to die.
there is a time to plant and a time to pull up plants.
there is a time to kill and a time to heal.
there is a time to destroy and a time to build.
there is a time to cry and a time to laugh.
there is a time to be sad and a time to dance with joy.
there is a time to throw weapons down and a time to pick them up.
there is a time to hug someone and a time to stop holding so tightly.
there is a time to look for something and a time to consider it lost.
there is a time to keep things and a time to throw things away.

there is a time to be silent and a time to speak.
there is a time to love and a time to hate.
there is a time for war and a time for peace.
do people really gain anything from their hard work?
i saw all the hard work god gave us to do.
god gave us the ability to think about his world, but we can never completely understand everything he does.
and yet, he does everything at just the right time.
i learned that the best thing for people to do is to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live.
god wants everyone to eat, drink, and enjoy their work.
these are gifts from god.
i learned that anything god does will continue forever.
people cannot add anything to the work of god, and they cannot take anything away from it.
god did this so that people would respect him.
what happened in the past has happened, and what will happen in the future will happen.
but god wants to help those who have been treated badly.
i also saw these things in this life: i saw that the courts should be filled with goodness and fairness, but there is evil there now.
so i said to myself, “god has planned a time for everything, and he has planned a time to judge everything people do.
he will judge good people and bad people.” 
i thought about what people do to each other.
and i said to myself, “god wants people to see that they are like animals.
the same thing happens to animals and to people—they die.
people and animals have the same ‘breath.’ is a dead animal different from a dead person?
it is all so senseless!
the bodies of people and animals end the same way.
they came from the earth, and, in the end, they will go back to the earth.
who knows what happens to a person’s spirit?
who knows if a human’s spirit goes up to god while an animal’s spirit goes down into the ground?” 
so i saw that the best thing people can do is to enjoy what they do, because that is all they have.
besides, no one can help another person see what will happen in the future.
chapter 24.
the word of the lord came to me.
this was on the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year of exile.
he said, 
“son of man, write today’s date and this note: ‘on this date the army of the king of babylon surrounded jerusalem.’ 
the people there refuse to obey me.
i have a story with a message for them.
tell them, ‘this is what the lord god says: “‘put the pot on the fire.
put on the pot and pour in the water.
put in the pieces of meat.
put in every good piece, the thighs and the shoulders.
fill the pot with the best bones.
use the best animals in the flock.
pile the wood under the pot, and boil the pieces of meat.
boil the soup until even the bones are cooked.
“‘so this is what the lord god says: it will be bad for jerusalem.
it will be bad for that city of murderers.
jerusalem is like a pot with rust on it, and those spots of rust cannot be removed!
that pot is not clean, and the rust cannot be removed, so the meat must be thrown out and not divided among the priests.
jerusalem is like a pot with rust on it.
this is because the blood from the murders is still there!
she put the blood on the bare rock.
she did not pour the blood on the ground and cover it with dirt.
i put her blood on the bare rock so that it would not be covered.
i did this so that people would become angry and punish her for killing innocent people.
“‘so this is what the lord god says: it will be bad for that city of murderers!
i will pile up plenty of wood for the fire.
put plenty of wood under the pot.
light the fire.
cook the meat until it is well done.
mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned up.
then let the pot stand empty on the coals.
let it become so hot that its stains begin to glow.
those stains will be melted away.
the rust will be destroyed.
“‘jerusalem might work hard to scrub away her stains.
but that ‘rust’ will not go away!
only the fire of punishment will remove it.
“‘you sinned against me and became stained with sin.
i wanted to wash you and make you clean, but the stains would not come out.
i will not try washing you again until my hot anger is finished with you!
“‘i am the lord.
i said your punishment would come, and i will make it happen.
i will not hold back the punishment or feel sorry for you.
i will punish you for the evil things you did.
this is what the lord god said.’” 
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, you love your wife very much, but i am going to take her away from you.
your wife will die suddenly, but you must not show your sadness.
you must not cry loudly.
you will cry and your tears will fall, 
but you must mourn quietly.
dress as you normally do; wear your turban and sandals; don’t cover your mustache, and don’t eat the food people normally eat when someone dies.” 
the next morning i told the people what god had said.
that evening, my wife died.
the next morning i did what god commanded.
then the people said to me, “why are you doing this?
what does it mean?” 
then i said to them, “the word of the lord came to me.
he told me 
to speak to the family of israel.
the lord god said, ‘look, i will destroy my holy place.
you are proud of that place and sing songs of praise about it.
you love to see it.
you really love that place.
but i will destroy it, and your children that you left behind will be killed in battle.
but you will do the same things that i have done about my dead wife.
you will not cover your mustache or eat the food people normally eat when someone dies.
you will wear your turbans and your sandals.
you will not show your sadness publicly or cry publicly, but you will waste away with guilt and talk to each other quietly about your grief.
so ezekiel is an example for you.
you will do all the same things he did.
that time of punishment will come, and then you will know that i am the lord god.’” 
the lord said, “son of man, i will take away the place that makes the people feel safe—jerusalem, that beautiful city that makes them so happy.
they really love that place.
they love to look at it.
but i will take it away from them, and i will also take their children.
on that day one of the survivors will come to you with the bad news about jerusalem.
that same day you will be able to talk to the messenger.
you will not be silent anymore.
this will be a sign to the people, and they will know that i am the lord.” 
2 kings.
chapter 20.
at that time hezekiah became sick and almost died.
the prophet isaiah son of amoz went to see him and told him, “the lord says, ‘you will die soon, so you should tell your family what they should do when you die.
you will not get well.’” 
hezekiah turned his face to the wall that faced the temple and began praying to the lord.
“lord, remember that i have sincerely served you with all my heart.
i have done what you say is good.” then hezekiah cried very hard.
before isaiah had left the middle courtyard, he received this message from the lord, 
“go back and speak to hezekiah, the leader of my people.
tell him, ‘this is what the lord, the god of your ancestor david, says: i heard your prayer and i saw your tears, so i will heal you.
on the third day you will go up to the temple of the lord.
i will add 15 years to your life.
i will save you and this city from the king of assyria.
i will protect this city.
i will do this for myself and because of the promise i made to my servant david.’” 
then isaiah said, “crush figs together and put them on your sore; you will get well.” so they took the mixture of figs and put it on hezekiah’s sore place, and he got well.
hezekiah asked isaiah, “what will be the sign that the lord will heal me, and that i will go up to the temple of the lord on the third day?” 
isaiah said, “which do you want?
should the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?
this is the sign for you from the lord to show that the lord will do what he said he would do.” 
hezekiah answered, “it is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten steps.
no, make the shadow go back ten steps.” 
then isaiah prayed, and the lord made the shadow move back ten steps.
it went back up the steps that it had already been on.
at that time merodach baladan son of baladan was king of babylon.
he sent letters and a gift to hezekiah when he heard that hezekiah had been sick.
hezekiah listened to the messengers and then showed them all the valuable things he owned.
he showed them the silver, the gold, the spices, the expensive perfume, and the building where he stored the weapons.
he showed them everything in his treasuries, in his palace, and in his kingdom.
then isaiah the prophet came to king hezekiah and asked him, “what did these men say?
where did they come from?” hezekiah said, “these men came from a faraway country, from babylon.” 
isaiah said, “what did they see in your palace?” hezekiah answered, “they saw everything i own.
i showed them all my wealth.” 
then isaiah said to hezekiah, “listen to this message from the lord.
the time is coming when everything in your palace and everything your ancestors have saved until today will be carried away to babylon.
nothing will be left!
the lord said this.
the babylonians will take your sons, and your sons will become officers in the palace of the king of babylon.” 
then hezekiah told isaiah, “this message from the lord is good.” (hezekiah said this because he thought, “there will be real peace and security during my lifetime.”) 
all the great things that hezekiah did, including his work on the pool and the aqueduct to bring water into the city, are written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
hezekiah died and was buried with his ancestors.
and his son manasseh became the new king after him.
chapter 1.
these are the commands that moses gave the israelites while they were in the jordan valley, in the desert east of the jordan river.
this was across from suph, between the desert of paran and the cities tophel, laban, hazeroth, and dizahab.
the trip from mount horeb through the mountains of seir to kadesh barnea takes only eleven days.
but it was 40 years from the time the israelites left egypt until the time they came to this place.
on the first day of the eleventh month of the 40th year, moses spoke to the people and told them everything the lord commanded.
this was after he defeated sihon and og.
(sihon was the king of the amorites and lived in heshbon.
og was the king of bashan and lived in ashtaroth and edrei.)
the israelites were in moab on the east side of the jordan river when moses began to explain what god had commanded: 
“at mount horeb the lord our god spoke to us.
he said, ‘you have stayed at this mountain long enough.
go to the hill country where the amorites live and to all the neighboring areas in the jordan valley, the hill country, the western slopes, the negev, and the seacoast.
go throughout the land of canaan and lebanon as far as the great river, the euphrates.
look, i am giving you this land.
go and take it.
it is the land that i, the lord, promised to give to your ancestors—abraham, isaac, and jacob.
i promised to give this land to them and to their descendants.’ 
“at that time i told you, ‘i can’t take care of you by myself.
and now, there are even more of you.
the lord your god has added more and more people, so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.
may the lord, the god of your ancestors, give you 1000 times more people than you are now!
may he bless you as he promised.
but i cannot take care of you and solve all your arguments by myself.
so choose some men from each tribe, and i will make them leaders over you.
choose wise men with experience who understand people.’ 
“and you said, ‘that is a good thing to do.’ 
“so i took the wise, experienced men you chose from your tribes, and i made them your leaders.
in this way i gave you leaders over 1000 people, over 100 people, over 50 people, and over 10 people.
i also gave you officers for each of your tribes.
“at that time i told these judges, ‘listen to the arguments between your people.
be fair when you judge each case.
it doesn’t matter if the problem is between two israelites or between an israelite and a foreigner.
you must judge each case fairly.
you must treat everyone the same when you judge.
you must listen carefully to everyone—whether they are important or not.
don’t be afraid of anyone, because your decision is from god.
but if there is a case too hard for you to judge, bring it to me and i will judge it.’ 
at that same time i also told you everything you must do.
“so we obeyed the lord our god.
we left mount horeb and went to the hill country of the amorites.
you remember that big, terrible desert that we walked through.
we came as far as kadesh barnea.
then i said to you, ‘you have now come to the hill country of the amorites.
the lord our god will give us this country.
look, there it is!
go up and take the land for your own.
the lord, the god of your ancestors, told you to do this, so don’t be afraid or worry about anything.’ 
“but all of you came to me and said, ‘let’s send some men to look at the land first.
they can spy out the land and come back and tell us the way we should go and which cities we will come to.’ 
“i thought that was a good idea.
so i chose twelve men from among you, one man from each tribe.
then they left and went up to the hill country.
they came to the valley of eshcol and explored it.
they took some of the fruit from that land and brought it back to us.
they told us about the land and said, ‘the lord our god is giving us a good land.’ 
“but you refused to go into the land.
you refused to obey the lord your god.
you went to your tents and began to complain.
you said, ‘the lord hates us!
he brought us out of the land of egypt just to let the amorites destroy us.
where can we go now?
the men we sent have frightened us with their report.
they said, “the people there are bigger and taller than we are.
the cities are big and have walls as high as the sky.
and we saw giants there!”’ 
“so i said to you, ‘don’t be upset or afraid of those people.
the lord your god is in front, leading you.
he will fight for you just as he did in egypt.
you saw what happened in the desert.
you saw how the lord your god carried you like a man carries his child.
he brought you safely all the way to this place.’ 
“but you didn’t trust the lord your god then either.
but he was always in front, going ahead to find a place for you to camp.
at night, he was in the fire that showed you where to go.
and during the day, he was in the cloud.
“the lord heard what you said, and he was angry.
he made a vow.
he said, 
‘not one of you evil people who are alive now will go into the good land that i promised to your ancestors.
only caleb son of jephunneh will see that land.
i will give caleb the land he walked on, and i will give that land to his descendants, because he did all that i, the lord, commanded.’ 
“the lord was also angry with me because of you.
he said to me, ‘moses, you cannot enter the land, either.
but your helper, joshua son of nun, will go into the land.
encourage joshua, because he will lead the israelites to take the land for their own.
you thought your little children would be taken by your enemies.
but those children, who are still too young to know right from wrong, will go into the land.
i will give it to them.
your children will take the land for their own.
but you—you must turn around, take the road to the red sea and go back into the desert.’ 
“then you said, ‘moses, we sinned against the lord, but now we will do what the lord our god commanded us before—we will go and fight.’ “then each of you put on your weapons.
you thought it would be easy to go and take the hill country.
but the lord said to me, ‘tell the people not to go up there and fight, because i will not be with them.
their enemies will defeat them!’ 
“i spoke to you, but you did not listen.
you refused to obey the lord’s command.
you thought you could use your own power, so you went up into the hill country.
the amorites who lived there came out like a swarm of bees and chased you all the way from seir to hormah.
then you came back crying to the lord for help, but the lord refused to listen to you.
so you stayed at kadesh for such a long time.
chapter 2.
the lord’s message came to me: 
“jeremiah, go and speak to the people of jerusalem.
tell them that this is what the lord says: “‘at the time you were a young nation, you were faithful to me.
you followed me like a young bride.
you followed me through the desert, through a land that had never been used for farmland.
the people of israel were a holy gift to the lord.
they were the first fruit he gathered.
any people who tried to hurt them were judged guilty.
bad things happened to those wicked people.’” this message is from the lord.
family of jacob, hear the lord’s message.
tribes of israel, listen.
this is what the lord says: “do you think that i was not fair to your ancestors?
is that why they turned away from me?
your ancestors worshiped worthless idols, and they became worthless themselves.
your ancestors did not say, ‘the lord brought us out of egypt.
he led us through the desert, through a dry and rocky land.
he led us through a dark and dangerous land.
no one lives there; people don’t even travel through that land.
but the lord led us through that land.
so where is he now?’ 
“i brought you into a good land, a land filled with many good things.
i did this so that you could eat the fruit and crops that grow there.
but you only made my land ‘dirty.’ i gave that land to you, but you made it a bad place.
“the priests did not ask, ‘where is the lord?’ the people who know the law did not want to know me.
the leaders of the people of israel turned against me.
the prophets spoke in the name of the false god baal.
they worshiped worthless idols.” 
the lord says, “so now i will accuse you again, and i will also accuse your grandchildren.
go across the sea to the islands of kittim.
send someone to the land of kedar.
look very carefully.
see if anyone has ever done anything like this.
has any nation ever stopped worshiping their old gods so that they could worship new gods?
and their gods are not really gods at all!
but my people stopped worshiping their glorious god and started worshiping idols that are worth nothing.
“skies, be shocked at what happened!
shake with great fear!” this message is from the lord.
“my people have done two evil things.
they turned away from me, and they dug their own water cisterns.
i am the source of living water; those cisterns are broken and cannot hold water.
“israel is not a slave, is he?
he was not born a slave, was he?
then why did the enemy carry him away as a captive?
like a lion the enemy has roared at israel.
they have destroyed your land.
your cities have been burned, and no one is left in them.
people from memphis and tahpanhes have smashed the top of your head.
this trouble is your own fault.
the lord your god was leading you the right way, but you turned away from him.
people of judah, think about this: how did it help you to go to egypt and drink from the nile river?
how did it help you to go to assyria and drink from the euphrates river?
you have done wrong, and that will only bring punishment to you.
trouble will come to you, and it will teach you a lesson.
think about it and understand how bad it is to turn away from the lord your god.
it is wrong not to fear and respect me.” this message is from lord god all-powerful.
“judah, long ago you broke free from me, like an ox that breaks its yoke and the ropes that held it.
you said to me, ‘i will not serve you!’ on every high hill and under every green tree, you acted like a prostitute.
judah, i planted you like a special vine.
you were all from good seed.
how did you turn into a different vine that grows bad fruit?
even if you wash yourself with lye, even if you use much soap, i can still see your guilt.” this message is from the lord god.
“judah, how can you say to me, ‘i am not guilty because i have not worshiped the baal idols’?
think about what you did in the valley.
think about what you have done.
you are like a fast she-camel that runs from place to place.
you are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert.
at mating time, she sniffs the wind.
no one can control her when she is in heat.
at mating time, every male that wants her will get her.
she is easy to find.
judah, stop chasing after idols!
stop wanting those other gods.
but you say, ‘it is no use!
i cannot stop!
i love those other gods.
i can’t stop chasing them.’ 
“a thief is ashamed when people catch him stealing.
the people of israel should be ashamed too and so should their kings and leaders, priests and prophets.
they say to pieces of wood, ‘you are my father.’ they say to a rock, ‘you gave birth to me.’ all these people will be ashamed.
they don’t look to me for help.
they have turned their backs to me.
but when the people of judah get into trouble, they say to me, ‘come and save us!’ 
but where are the idols you made for yourselves?
let’s see if they come and save you when you are in trouble!
people of judah, you have as many idols as you have cities!
“why do you argue with me?
you have all turned against me.” this message was from the lord.
“i punished you people of judah, but it did not help.
you did not come back when you were punished.
with your swords you killed the prophets who came to you.
like a dangerous lion, you killed the prophets.” 
people of this generation, pay attention to the lord’s message!
“have i been like a desert to the people of israel?
have i been like a dark and dangerous land to them?
my people say, ‘we are free to go our own way.
we will not come back to you!’ why do they say these things?
a young woman does not forget her jewelry.
a bride does not forget to wear her wedding dress.
but my people have forgotten me too many times to count.
“judah, you have become so good at finding lovers.
even the worst women could learn some evil ways from you.
you have blood on your hands!
it is the blood of poor, innocent people.
you did not catch them breaking into your house.
you killed them for no reason!
but still, you say, ‘i am innocent.
god is not angry with me.’ so i will also judge you guilty of lying, because you say, ‘i have done nothing wrong.’ 
you go from one place to another looking for help, always changing your mind.
but egypt will also disappoint you, just as assyria did.
so you will eventually leave egypt too, and you will hide your face in shame.
you trusted these countries, but the lord rejected them, so they cannot help you win.
chapter 25.
a song of david.
lord, i put my life in your hands.
i trust in you, my god, and i will not be disappointed.
my enemies will not laugh at me.
no one who trusts in you will be disappointed.
but disappointment will come to those who try to deceive others.
they will get nothing.
lord, help me learn your ways.
show me how you want me to live.
guide me and teach me your truths.
you are my god, my savior.
you are the one i have been waiting for.
remember to be kind to me, lord.
show me the tender love that you have always had.
don’t remember the sinful things i did when i was young.
because you are good, lord, remember me with your faithful love.
the lord is good and does what is right.
he shows sinners the right way to live.
he teaches his ways to humble people.
he leads them with fairness.
the lord is kind and true to those who obey what he said in his agreement.
lord, i have done many wrong things.
but i ask you to forgive them all to show your goodness.
when people choose to follow the lord, he shows them the best way to live.
they will enjoy good things, and their children will get the land god promised.
the lord tells his secrets to his followers.
he teaches them about his agreement.
i always look to the lord for help.
only he can free me from my troubles.
i am hurt and lonely.
turn to me, and show me mercy.
free me from my troubles.
help me solve my problems.
look at my trials and troubles.
forgive me for all the sins i have done.
look at all the enemies i have.
they hate me and want to hurt me.
protect me!
save me from them!
i come to you for protection, so don’t let me be disappointed.
you are good and do what is right.
i trust you to protect me.
god, save the people of israel from all their enemies.
chapter 4.
“now, israel, listen to the laws and to the commands that i teach you.
obey them and you will live.
then you can go in and take the land that the lord, the god of your ancestors, is giving you.
you must not add to what i command you.
and you must not take anything away.
you must obey the commands of the lord your god that i have given you.
“you have seen what the lord did at baal peor.
the lord your god destroyed all your people who followed the false god baal at that place.
but all of you who stayed with the lord your god are alive today.
“i taught you the laws and rules that the lord my god commanded me.
i did this so you could obey them in the land you are ready to enter and take for your own.
obey these laws carefully.
this will show the people of the other nations that you are wise and sensible.
they will hear about these laws and say, ‘truly, the people of this great nation are wise and sensible.’ 
“the lord our god is near when we ask him to help us.
no other nation has a god like that!
and no other nation is great enough to have laws and rules as good as the teachings i give you today.
but you must be careful!
be sure that as long as you live you never forget what you have seen.
you must teach these things to your children and grandchildren.
remember the day you stood before the lord your god at mount horeb.
the lord said to me, ‘gather the people together to listen to what i have to say.
then they will learn to respect me as long as they live on earth.
and they will teach these things to their children.’ 
you came near and stood at the bottom of the mountain.
the mountain burned with fire that reached up to the sky.
there were thick black clouds and darkness.
then the lord spoke to you from the fire.
you heard the sound of someone speaking, but you did not see any form.
there was only a voice.
the lord told you about his agreement, which he commanded you to obey.
he told you about the ten commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets.
at that time the lord also commanded me to teach you the other laws and rules that you must follow in the land you are going to take and live in.
“on the day the lord spoke to you from the fire at mount horeb, you did not see him—there was no shape for god.
so be careful!
don’t sin and destroy yourselves by making false gods or statues in the shape of any living thing.
don’t make an idol that looks like a man or a woman, 
or like an animal on the earth, or like a bird that flies in the sky.
and don’t make an idol that looks like anything that crawls on the ground or like a fish in the sea.
and be careful when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon, and the stars—all the many things in the sky.
be careful that you are not tempted to worship and serve them.
the lord your god lets the other people in the world do this.
but the lord brought you out of egypt to make you his own special people.
he saved you from egypt.
it was as if he pulled you from a hot furnace.
and now you are his people.
“the lord was angry with me because of you.
he swore that i could not go across the jordan river into the good land that the lord your god is giving you.
so i must die here in this land.
i cannot go across the jordan river, but you will soon go across it and take that good land and live there.
you must be careful not to forget the agreement that the lord your god made with you.
you must obey the lord’s command.
don’t make any idols in any form, 
because the lord your god hates for his people to worship other gods.
and he can be like a fire that destroys!
“you will live in the country a long time.
you will have children and grandchildren there.
after all that time, be sure that you do not then ruin your lives by making any kind of idol!
that is something the lord your god considers evil, and it would make him very angry!
so i am warning you now.
heaven and earth are my witnesses!
if you do such an evil thing, you will quickly be destroyed!
you are crossing the jordan river now to take that land.
but if you make any idols, you will not live there very long.
no, you will be destroyed completely!
the lord will scatter you among the nations.
and only a few of you will be left alive to go to the countries where the lord will send you.
there you will serve gods made by men—things made of wood and stone that cannot see or hear or eat or smell!
but there in these other lands you will look for the lord your god.
and if you look for him with all your heart and soul, you will find him.
when you are in trouble—when all these things happen to you—then you will come back to the lord your god and obey him.
the lord your god is a merciful god!
he will not leave you there or destroy you completely.
he will not forget the agreement that he made with your ancestors.
“has anything this great ever happened before?
look at the past.
think about everything that happened before you were born.
go all the way back to the time when god made people on the earth.
look at everything that has happened anywhere in the world.
has anyone ever heard about anything as great as this?
you people heard god speaking to you from a fire, and you are still alive.
has that ever happened to anyone else?
has any other god ever tried to go and take a people for himself from inside another nation?
but you yourselves have seen everything that the lord your god did for you.
he showed you his power and strength.
you saw the troubles that tested the people.
you saw miracles and wonders.
you saw war and the terrible things that happened.
the lord showed you all this so that you would know that he is god.
there is no other god like him.
he let you hear his voice from heaven so that he could teach you a lesson.
on earth he let you see his great fire, and he spoke to you from it.
“he loved your ancestors.
that is why he chose you, their descendants.
and that is why he brought you out of egypt.
he was with you and brought you out with his great power.
when you moved forward, he forced out nations that were greater and more powerful than you.
and he led you into their land.
he gave you their land to live in, as he is still doing today.
“so today you must remember and accept that the lord is god.
he is god in heaven above and on the earth below.
there is no other god!
and you must obey his laws and commands that i give you today.
then everything will go well with you and your children who live after you.
and you will live a long time in the land the lord your god is giving you—it will be yours forever.” 
then moses chose three cities on the east side of the jordan river.
any person who killed someone by accident and not out of hate could run away to one of these three cities and not be put to death.
the three cities that moses chose were bezer in the high plains for the tribe of reuben, ramoth in gilead for the tribe of gad, and golan in bashan for the tribe of manasseh.
moses gave god’s law to the israelites.
moses gave these teachings, laws, and rules to the people after they came out of egypt.
he gave them these laws while they were on the east side of the jordan river, in the valley across from beth peor.
they were in the land of sihon, the amorite king who lived at heshbon.
moses and the israelites had defeated sihon when they came out of egypt.
they took sihon’s land to keep.
they also took the land of king og of bashan.
these two amorite kings lived on the east side of the jordan river.
this land goes from aroer on the edge of the arnon valley all the way to mount sirion, that is, mount hermon.
this land also included the whole jordan valley on the east side of the jordan river.
to the south, this land reached to the dead sea.
to the east, it reached to the foot of mount pisgah.
chapter 24.
look, the lord is destroying this land.
he will clean out the land completely and force all the people to go far away.
at that time whatever happens to the common people will also happen to the priests.
slaves and masters will be the same.
women slaves and their women masters will be the same.
buyers and sellers will be the same.
those who borrow and those who lend will be the same.
bankers and those who owe the bank will be the same.
everyone will be forced out of the land.
all the wealth will be taken.
this will happen because the lord commanded it.
the country will be empty and sad.
the world will be empty and weak.
the great leaders of the people in this land will become weak.
the people have ruined the land.
they did what god said was wrong.
they did not obey god’s laws.
they made an agreement with god a long time ago, but they broke their agreement with god.
the people living in this land are guilty of doing wrong, so god promised to destroy the land.
the people will be punished, and only a few of them will survive.
the grapevines are dying.
the new wine is bad.
people who were happy are now sad.
they have stopped showing their joy.
the happy music from the drums and harps has ended.
they no longer sing as they drink their wine.
the beer now tastes bitter to those who drink it.
“total confusion” is a good name for this city.
the city has been destroyed.
people cannot enter the houses.
the doors are blocked.
people still ask for wine in the marketplaces, but all the joy is gone.
it was carried off with everything else.
all that is left is destruction.
even the gates are crushed.
at harvest time, people knock olives from the trees.
but a few olives are left in the trees.
it will be like that in this land and among the nations.
those who are left will begin shouting louder than the ocean.
they will rejoice about the lord’s greatness.
they will say, “people in the east, praise the lord!
people in faraway lands, praise the name of the lord, the god of israel.” 
we hear songs of praise for god from every place on earth.
they praise the god who does what is right.
but i say, “enough!
i have had enough.
what i see is terrible.
traitors are turning against people and hurting them.” 
i see troubles for you people living in this land.
i see fear, pits, and problems all around.
people will hear about the danger, and they will be afraid.
some of them will run away, but they will fall into holes and be trapped.
some of them will climb out of the holes, but they will be caught in another trap.
the floodgates in the sky above will open, and the floods will begin.
the foundations of the earth will shake.
there will be earthquakes, and the earth will split open.
the sins of the world are very heavy, so the earth will fall under the weight.
it will shake like an old house.
it will fall like a drunk.
it will not be able to stand.
at that time the lord will judge the heavenly armies in heaven and the earthly kings on earth.
many people will be gathered together.
they have been locked in the pit.
they have been in prison.
but finally, after a long time, they will be judged.
the lord will rule as king on mount zion in jerusalem.
his glory will be shown to the city leaders with such brightness that the moon will be embarrassed and the sun will be ashamed.
chapter 34.
then the lord said to moses, “make two more stone tablets like the first two that were broken.
i will write the same words on these stones that were written on the first two stones.
be ready tomorrow morning and come up on mount sinai.
stand before me there on the top of the mountain.
no one will be allowed to come with you.
no one should even be seen anywhere on the mountain.
even your herds of animals or flocks of sheep will not be allowed to eat grass at the bottom of the mountain.” 
so moses made two more stone tablets like the first ones.
early the next morning moses went up mount sinai, just as the lord had commanded.
moses carried the two stone tablets with him.
then the lord came down to him in a cloud, stood there with moses, and spoke his own name.
that is, the lord passed in front of moses and said, “yahweh, the lord, is a kind and merciful god.
he is slow to become angry.
he is full of great love.
he can be trusted.
he shows his faithful love to thousands of people.
he forgives people for the wrong things they do, but he does not forget to punish guilty people.
not only will he punish the guilty people, but their children, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren will also suffer for the bad things these people do.” 
then moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped the lord.
moses said, 
“lord, if you are pleased with me, please go with us.
i know that these are stubborn people, but forgive us for the bad things we did.
accept us as your people.” 
then the lord said, “i am making this agreement with all of your people.
i will do amazing things that have never before been done for any other nation on earth.
the people with you will see that i, the lord, am very great.
they will see the wonderful things that i will do for you.
obey what i command you today, and i will force your enemies to leave your land.
i will force out the amorites, canaanites, hittites, perizzites, hivites, and jebusites.
be careful!
don’t make any agreement with the people who live in the land where you are going.
if you make an agreement with them, it will bring you trouble.
so destroy their altars, break the stones they worship, and cut down their idols.
don’t worship any other god.
i am yahweh kanah—the jealous lord.
that is my name.
i hate for my people to worship other gods.
“be careful not to make any agreements with the people who live in that land.
if you do this, you might join them when they worship their gods.
they will invite you to join them, and you will eat their sacrifices.
you might choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons.
those daughters serve false gods.
they might lead your sons to do the same thing.
“don’t make idols.
“celebrate the festival of unleavened bread.
for seven days, eat the bread made without yeast as i commanded you before.
do this during the month i have chosen, the month of abib, because that is the month you came out of egypt.
“a woman’s first baby always belongs to me.
even the first animals that are born from your cattle or sheep belong to me.
if you want to keep a donkey that is the first born, then you can buy it with a lamb.
but if you don’t buy that donkey with a lamb, you must break the donkey’s neck.
you must buy back all of your firstborn sons from me.
no one should come before me without a gift.
“you will work for six days, but on the seventh day you must rest.
you must rest even during the times of planting and harvesting.
“celebrate the festival of harvest.
use the first grain from the wheat harvest for this festival.
and in the fall celebrate the festival of shelters.
“three times each year all your men must go to be with the lord god, the god of israel.
“when you go into your land, i will force your enemies out of that land.
i will expand your borders—you will get more and more land.
you will go before the lord your god three times each year.
at that time no one will try to take your land from you.
“when you kill an animal and offer its blood as a sacrifice, you must not include anything that has yeast in it.
“don’t let any of the meat from the passover meal remain until morning.
“give the lord the very first crops that you harvest.
bring them to the house of the lord your god.
“never cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.” 
then the lord said to moses, “write everything that i have told you.
this is the agreement that i made with you and the israelites.” 
moses stayed there with the lord for 40 days and 40 nights.
moses did not eat any food or drink any water.
and he wrote the words of the agreement (the ten commandments) on the two stone tablets.
when moses came down from mount sinai, he carried the two stone tablets of the agreement.
because he had talked with the lord, his face was shining, but he did not know it.
aaron and all the people of israel saw that moses’ face was shining bright.
so they were afraid to go near him.
but moses called to them.
so aaron and all the leaders of the people went to him.
moses talked with them.
after that all the israelites came near moses, and he gave them the commands that the lord had given him on mount sinai.
when moses finished speaking to the people, he put a covering over his face.
any time moses went before the lord to speak with him, moses took off the covering.
then moses would come out and tell the israelites what the lord commanded.
the people would see that moses’ face was shining bright, so he would cover his face again.
he kept his face covered until the next time he went in to speak with the lord.
chapter 26.
after the great sickness, the lord spoke to moses and eleazar son of aaron the priest.
he said, “count the israelites.
count all the men who are 20 years old or older and list them by families.
these are the men who are able to serve in the army of israel.” 
at this time the people were camped in the jordan valley in moab.
this was near the jordan river, across from jericho.
so moses and eleazar the priest spoke to the people.
they said, 
“you must count every man who is 20 years old or older.
the lord gave moses this command.” here is the list of the israelites who came out of egypt: 
these are the people from the tribe of reuben.

the lord said to moses, 
“the land will be divided and given to these people.
each tribe will get enough land for all the people who were counted.
a large tribe will get much land, and a small tribe will get less land.
the land that they get will be equal to the number of people who were counted.
but you must use lots to decide which tribe gets which part of the land.
each tribe will get its share of the land, and that land will be given the name of that tribe.
land will be given to each tribe—large and small.
and you will throw lots to make the decisions.” 
they also counted the tribe of levi.
these are the family groups from the tribe of levi: gershon—the gershonite family group; kohath—the kohathite family group; merari—the merarite family group.
these are also family groups from the tribe of levi: the libnite family group; the hebronite family group; the mahlite family group; the mushite family group; the korahite family group.

amram and jochebed had two sons, aaron and moses.
they also had a daughter, miriam.
aaron was the father of nadab, abihu, eleazar, and ithamar.
but nadab and abihu died.
they died because they made an offering to the lord with fire that was not allowed.
the total number of males one month or older from the tribe of levi was 23,000. but these men were not counted with the other israelites.
they did not get a share of the land that the lord gave to the other people.
moses and eleazar the priest counted all these people.
they counted the israelites while they were in the jordan valley in moab.
this was near the jordan river across from jericho.
many years before, in the desert of sinai, moses and aaron the priest counted the israelites.
but all these people were dead.
not one of them was still alive, 
because the lord told them that they would all die in the desert.
the only two men who were left alive were caleb son of jephunneh and joshua son of nun.
chapter 14.
to the director: a song of david.
only fools think there is no god.
people like that are evil and do terrible things.
they never do what is right.
the lord looks down from heaven to see if there is anyone who is wise, anyone who looks to him for help.
but everyone has gone the wrong way.
everyone has turned bad.
no one does anything good.
no, not one person!
those who are evil treat my people like bread to be eaten.
and they never ask for the lord’s help.
don’t they know what they are doing?
they will have plenty to fear, because god is with those who do what is right.
you wicked people want to spoil the hopes of the poor, but the lord will protect them.
i wish the one who lives on mount zion would bring victory to israel!
when the lord makes his people successful again, the people of jacob will be happy; the people of israel will be glad.
chapter 50.
this is what the lord says: “people of israel, you say that i divorced your mother, jerusalem.
but where is the legal paper that proves i divorced her?
my children, did i owe money to someone?
did i sell you to pay a debt?
no, you were sold because of the bad things you did.
your mother was sent away because of the bad things you did.
i came home and found no one there.
i called and called, but no one answered.
do you think i cannot get you back?
do you think i cannot save you?
look, if i gave the command, the ocean would dry up!
i can turn rivers into a desert.
the fish would die without water, and their bodies would rot.
i can make the skies dark.
i can cover the skies in darkness as black as sackcloth.” 
the lord god gave me the ability to teach, so now i teach these sad people.
every morning he wakes me and teaches me like a student.
the lord god helps me learn, and i have not turned against him.
i will not stop following him.
i will let those people beat me and pull the hair from my beard.
i will not hide my face when they say bad things to me and spit at me.
the lord god will help me, so the bad things they say will not hurt me.
i will be strong.
i know i will not be disappointed.
god is with me, and he is the one who shows that i am innocent.
so no one can say i am guilty.
if anyone wants to try to prove me wrong, they should come here, and we will have a trial.
but look, the lord god helps me, so no one can prove me guilty.
as for them, they will all be like worthless old clothes, eaten by moths.
people who respect the lord also listen to his servant.
that servant lives completely trusting in god without knowing what will happen.
he really trusts in the lord’s name and depends on his god.
the lord says, “look, you people want to do whatever you want.
so light your own fires and torches, but you will be punished.
you will fall into your fires and torches and be burned.
i will make that happen.” 
job.
chapter 26.
then job answered: 
“bildad, what a great help you are to this tired, weary man!
you have really supported me!
you have given such wonderful advice to this foolish man!
you have provided so much useful information!
who helped you say these things?
whose spirit inspired you to speak?
“the ghosts and their neighbors in the underworld shake with fear.
but god can see clearly into that place of death.
death is not hidden from god.
god stretched the northern sky over empty space.
he hung the earth on nothing.
he fills the thick clouds with water.
but he does not let its heavy weight break the clouds open.
he covers the face of the full moon.
he spreads his clouds over it and hides it.
he drew the horizon on the ocean, like a circle where light and darkness meet.
the foundations that hold up the sky shake with fear when god threatens them.
with his own power god calmed the sea.
with his wisdom he destroyed rahab.
his breath made the skies clear.
his hand destroyed the snake that tried to get away.
these are only a few of the amazing things god has done.
we hear only a small whisper of god’s thundering power.” 
2 chronicles.
chapter 15.
the spirit of god came on azariah, who was obed’s son.
azariah went to meet asa and said, “listen to me, asa and all you people of judah and benjamin.
the lord is with you when you are with him.
if you look for him, you will find him.
but if you leave him, he will leave you.
for a long time israel was without the true god.
and they were without a teaching priest, and without the law.
but when the israelites had trouble, they turned again to the lord, the god of israel.
they looked for him and found him.
in those times of trouble, no one could travel safely.
there was great trouble in all the nations.
one nation would destroy another nation and one city would destroy another city.
this was happening because god gave them all kinds of trouble.
but asa, you and the people of judah and benjamin, be strong.
don’t be weak and don’t give up, because you will get a reward for your good work!” 
asa felt encouraged when he heard these words and the message from obed the prophet.
then he removed the hated idols from the whole area of judah and benjamin.
he also removed the hated idols from the towns he had captured in the hill country of ephraim.
and he repaired the lord’s altar that was in front of the porch of the lord’s temple.
then asa gathered all the people from judah and benjamin and the people from the tribes of ephraim, manasseh, and simeon who had moved from the country of israel to live in the country of judah.
a great many of these people came to judah because they saw that the lord, asa’s god, was with him.
asa and these people gathered together in jerusalem on the third month in the 15th year of asa’s rule.
at that time they sacrificed 700 bulls and 7000 sheep and goats to the lord.
asa’s army had taken the animals and other valuable things from their enemies.
then they made an agreement to serve the lord god with all their heart and with all their soul.
he is the god their ancestors served.
anyone who refused to serve the lord god was to be killed.
it did not matter if that person was important or not or if that person was a man or woman.
then asa and the people made an oath to the lord.
they shouted it out loudly and blew their trumpets and rams’ horns.
all the people of judah were happy about the oath, because they had promised with all their heart.
they followed god with all their heart.
they looked for god and found him, so the lord gave them peace in all the country.
king asa also removed maacah, his mother, from being queen mother.
he did this because she had set up one of those awful poles to honor the goddess asherah.
asa cut down that asherah pole, smashed it into small pieces, and burned the pieces in the kidron valley.
asa did not destroy the high places, even though he was faithful to god all his life.
asa and his father had given some special gifts to god.
asa put these gifts of gold, silver, and other things into the temple.
there was no more war until the 35th year of asa’s rule.
chapter 25.
“when two people have an argument, they should go to the court.
the judges will decide which person is right and which is wrong.
if the judge decides a person must be beaten with a whip, the judge must make that person lie face down.
someone will beat the guilty person while the judge watches.
the number of times he must be hit depends on the crime.
don’t hit anyone more than 40 times during punishment, because more than that means that their life is not important to you.
“when an animal is being used to separate grain, you must not cover its mouth to stop it from eating.
“if two brothers live together, and one of them dies without a son, the wife of the dead man must not marry a stranger outside the family.
her husband’s brother must take her as his wife and have sexual relations with her.
he must do the duty of a husband’s brother for her.
then the first son she has will be considered the dead man’s son in order to keep the dead man’s name alive in israel.
if the man does not want to take his brother’s wife, she must go to the town meeting place and tell the leaders, ‘my husband’s brother refuses to keep his brother’s name alive in israel.
he will not do the duty of a husband’s brother to me.’ 
then the leaders of the city must call the man and talk to him.
if the man is stubborn and says, ‘i don’t want to take her,’ 
then his brother’s wife must come to him in front of the leaders.
she must take his sandal off his foot and spit in his face.
she must say, ‘this is being done to the man who will not give his brother a son!’ 
from then on, the brother’s family will be known in israel as, ‘the family of the man whose sandal was removed.’ 
“two men might be fighting against each other.
one man’s wife might come to help her husband, but she must not grab the other man’s private parts.

don’t feel sorry for her.
“don’t use weights that are too heavy or too light.
don’t keep measures in your house that are too large or too small.
you must use weights and measures that are correct and accurate.

yes, he hates all people who do wrong.
“remember what the amalekites did to you when you were coming from egypt.
the amalekites did not respect god.
they attacked you when you were weak and tired.
they killed all your people who were slow and walking behind everyone else.
that is why you must destroy the memory of the amalekites from the world.
you will do this when you enter the land that the lord your god is giving you.
there he will give you rest from all the enemies around you.
but do not forget to destroy the amalekites!

chapter 9.
then on the 24th day of that same month, the israelites gathered together for a day of fasting.
they wore sackcloth and put ashes on their heads to show they were sad and upset.
those people who were true israelites separated themselves from foreigners.
the israelites stood and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
they stood there for about three hours, and the people read the book of the law of the lord their god.
then for three more hours they confessed their sins and bowed down to worship the lord their god.
then these levites stood on the stairs: jeshua, bani, kadmiel, shebaniah, bunni, sherebiah, bani, and kenani.
they called out to the lord their god with loud voices.
then these levites spoke again: jeshua, bani, kadmiel, bani, hashabneiah, sherebiah, hodiah, shebaniah, and pethahiah.
they said, “stand up and praise the lord your god!
god has always lived and will live forever.
“people should praise your glorious name.
may your name be lifted above all blessing and praise.
you are god.
lord, only you are god.
you made the sky and the highest heavens and everything in them.
you made the earth and everything on it.
you made the seas and everything in them.
you give life to everything.
all the heavenly angels bow down and worship you.
you are the lord, the god who chose abram.
you led him from ur in babylonia.
you changed his name to abraham.
you saw he was true and loyal to you, and you made an agreement with him.
you promised to give him the land of the canaanites, hittites, and amorites, perizzites, jebusites, and girgashites.
but you promised to give that land to abraham’s descendants.
and you kept your promise because you are good.
you saw our ancestors suffering in egypt and heard them call for help by the red sea.
you showed the miracles to pharaoh.
you did amazing things to his officials and his people.
you knew that the egyptians thought they were better than our ancestors.
but you proved how great you are, and they remember that even today.
you split the red sea in front of them, and they walked through on dry land.
the egyptian soldiers were chasing them, but you threw that enemy into the sea.
and they sank like a rock into the sea.
with the tall cloud, you led them by day, and at night you used the column of fire.
that is the way you lit their path and showed them where to go.
then you came down to mount sinai.
you spoke to them from heaven.
you gave them good laws.
you gave them true teachings.
you gave them laws and commands that were very good.
you told them about your special day of rest—the sabbath.
through your servant moses, you gave them commands, laws, and teachings.
they were hungry, so you gave them food from heaven.
they were thirsty, so you gave them water from a rock.
you told them, ‘come, take this land.’ you used your power, and took the land for them.
but our ancestors became proud and stubborn.
they refused to obey your commands.
they refused to listen.
they forgot the amazing things you did with them.
they became stubborn.
they decided to return to egypt and become slaves again.
“but you are a forgiving god!
you are kind and full of mercy.
you are patient and full of love.
so you didn’t leave them!
you didn’t leave them even when they made golden calves and said, ‘these are the gods that led us out of egypt.’ 
you are very kind, so you didn’t leave them in the desert.
you didn’t take the tall cloud away from them by day.
you continued to lead them.
you didn’t take the column of fire away from them at night.
you continued to light their path and to show them which way to go.
you gave them your good spirit to make them wise.
you gave them manna for food.
you gave them water for their thirst.
you took care of them for 40 years.
they had all they needed in the desert.
their clothes didn’t wear out, and their feet didn’t swell and hurt.
you gave them kingdoms and nations, and you gave them faraway places where few people live.
they got the land of king sihon of heshbon.
they got the land of king og of bashan.
you made their descendants as many as the stars in the sky.
you brought them to the land you promised to give their ancestors.
they went in and took that land.
their children took the land.
they defeated the canaanites living there.
you let them defeat those people.
you let them do whatever they wanted to those nations, people, and kings.
they defeated powerful cities.
they took the fertile land.
they got houses filled with good things.
they got wells that were already dug.
they got vineyards, olive trees, and plenty of fruit trees.
they ate until they were full and fat.
they enjoyed all the wonderful things you gave them.
and then they turned against you.
they threw away your teachings.
they killed your prophets.
those prophets warned the people.
they tried to bring them back to you.
but our ancestors said terrible things against you.
so you let their enemies have them.
the enemy caused them much trouble.
when trouble came, our ancestors called to you for help.
and in heaven, you heard them.
you are very kind, so you sent people to save them.
and they rescued them from their enemies.
then as soon as our ancestors were rested, they started doing terrible things again!
so you let the enemy defeat them and punish them.
they called to you for help, and in heaven you heard them and helped them.
you are so kind.
that happened so many times.
you warned them.
you told them to come back, but they were too proud.
they refused to listen to your commands.
if people obey your laws, they will live.
but our ancestors broke your laws.
they were stubborn.
they turned their backs on you.
they refused to listen.
“you were very patient with our ancestors.
you let them mistreat you for many years.
you warned them with your spirit.
you sent the prophets to warn them.
but our ancestors didn’t listen.
so you gave them to people in other countries.
“but you are so kind!
you didn’t completely destroy them.
you didn’t leave them.
you are such a kind and merciful god!
our god, you are the great god, the awesome, powerful soldier!
you are kind and loyal.
you keep your agreement.
we have had many troubles, and our troubles are important to you.
bad things happened to all our people, and to our kings and leaders, and to our priests and prophets.
those terrible things have happened from the days of the king of assyria until today!
but god, you were right about everything that happened to us.
you were right, and we were wrong.
our kings, leaders, priests, and fathers did not obey your law.
they didn’t listen to your commands.
they ignored your warnings.
our ancestors didn’t serve you even when they were living in their own kingdom.
they didn’t stop doing evil.
they enjoyed all the wonderful things you gave them.
they enjoyed the rich land and had plenty of room, but they didn’t stop their evil ways.
and now, we are slaves.
we are slaves in this land, the land you gave our ancestors so they could enjoy its fruit and all the good things that grow here.
the harvest is big in this land.
but we sinned, so that harvest goes to the kings you put over us.
they control us and our cattle.
they do anything they want.
we are in a lot of trouble.
“because of all these things, we are making an agreement that cannot be changed.
we are putting this agreement in writing.
our leaders, levites, and priests are signing their names to this agreement and sealing it with a seal.” 
psalm.
chapter 37.
a song of david.
don’t get upset about evil people.
don’t be jealous of those who do wrong.
they are like grass and other green plants that dry up quickly and then die.
so trust in the lord and do good.
live on your land and be dependable.
enjoy serving the lord, and he will give you whatever you ask for.
depend on the lord.
trust in him, and he will help you.
he will make it as clear as day that you are right.
everyone will see that you are being fair.
trust in the lord and wait quietly for his help.
don’t be angry when people make evil plans and succeed.
don’t become so angry and upset that you, too, want to do evil.
the wicked will be destroyed, but those who call to the lord for help will get the land he promised.
in a short time there will be no more evil people.
you can look for them all you want, but they will be gone.
humble people will get the land god promised, and they will enjoy peace.
the wicked plan bad things for those who are good.
they show their teeth in anger at them.
but our lord will laugh at them.
he will make sure they get what they deserve.
the wicked draw their swords to kill the poor and the helpless.
they aim their arrows to murder all who live right.
but their bows will break, and their swords will pierce their own hearts.
a few good people are better than a large crowd of those who are evil.
the wicked will be destroyed, but the lord cares for those who are good.
the lord protects pure people all their life.
their reward will continue forever.
when trouble comes, good people will not be destroyed.
when times of hunger come, good people will have plenty to eat.
but evil people are the lord’s enemies, and they will be destroyed.
their valleys will dry up and burn.
they will be destroyed completely.
the wicked borrow money and never pay it back.
but good people are kind and generous.
everyone the lord blesses will get the land he promised.
everyone he curses will be destroyed.
the lord shows us how we should live, and he is pleased when he sees people living that way.
if they stumble, they will not fall, because the lord reaches out to steady them.
i was young, and now i am old, but i have never seen good people left with no one to help them; i have never seen their children begging for food.
they are kind and generous, and their children are a blessing.
stop doing anything evil and do good, and you will always have a place to live.
the lord loves what is right, and he will never leave his followers without help.
he will always protect them, but he will destroy the families of the wicked.
good people will get the land god promised and will live on it forever.
those who do what is right give good advice.
their decisions are always fair.
they have learned god’s teachings, and they will never stop living right.
the wicked are always looking for ways to kill good people.
but the lord will not let the wicked defeat them.
he will not let good people be judged guilty.
do what the lord says, and wait for his help.
he will reward you and give you the land he promised.
you will see the wicked being forced to leave.
i once saw a wicked man who was powerful.
he was like a strong, healthy tree.
but then he was gone.
i looked for him, but i could not find him.
be pure and honest.
peace loving people will have many descendants.
but those who break the law will be destroyed completely.
and their descendants will be forced to leave the land.
the lord saves those who are good.
when they have troubles, he is their strength.
the lord helps good people and rescues them.
they depend on him, so he rescues them from the wicked.
chapter 98.
a song of praise.
sing a new song to the lord, because he has done amazing things!
his powerful and holy right arm has brought him another victory.
the lord showed the nations his power to save.
he showed them his goodness.
he has kept his promise of love and loyalty to the people of israel.
people everywhere have seen our god’s power to save.
everyone on earth, shout with joy to the lord.
start singing happy songs of praise!
praise the lord with harps.
yes, praise him with music from the harps.
blow the pipes and horns, and shout for joy to the lord our king!
let the sea and everything in it, the earth and all who live in it shout his praise!
rivers, clap your hands!
all together now, mountains sing out!
sing before the lord because he is coming to judge the world.
he will rule the world fairly.
he will rule the people with goodness.
chapter 5.
“priests, nation of israel, and people in the king’s family, listen to me.
you have been judged guilty!
“you were like a trap at mizpah and like a net spread on the ground at tabor.
you have done many evil things, so i will punish you all.
i know ephraim.
i know what israel has done.
ephraim, right now you act like a prostitute.
israel is dirty with sin.
the people of israel have done many evil things, and these evil things keep them from coming back to their god.
they are always thinking of ways to chase after other gods.
they don’t know the lord.
israel’s pride is a witness against them, so israel and ephraim will stumble in their sin.
but judah will also stumble with them.
“the leaders of the people went to look for the lord.
they took their sheep and cattle with them, but they did not find the lord because he refused to accept them.
they have not been faithful to the lord.
their children are from some stranger.
and now, he will destroy them and their land again.
“blow the horn in gibeah.
blow the trumpet in ramah.
give the warning at beth aven.
the enemy is behind you, benjamin.
ephraim will become empty at the time of punishment.
i, god, warn the families of israel that this really will happen.
the leaders of judah are like thieves trying to steal someone’s property, so i will pour out my anger on them like water.
ephraim will be punished.
he will be crushed and pressed like grapes, because he decided to follow filth.
i will destroy ephraim as a moth eats a piece of cloth.
i will ruin judah, like rot on a piece of wood.
ephraim saw his sickness, and judah saw his wound, so they went to assyria for help.
they told their problems to the great king, but he cannot heal you or cure your wound.
i will be like a lion to ephraim, like a young lion to the nation of judah.
i—yes, i myself—will rip them to pieces.
i will carry them away, and no one can save them.
i will go back to my place, until the people admit they are guilty, until they come looking for me.
yes, in their trouble they will try very hard to find me.”

chapter 22.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, will you judge the city of murderers?
will you tell her about all the terrible things she has done?
you must say, ‘this is what the lord god says: the city is full of murderers, so her time of punishment will come.
she made filthy idols for herself, and those idols made her filthy!
“‘people of jerusalem, you killed many people.
you made filthy idols.
you are guilty, and the time has come to punish you.
your end has come.
other nations will make fun of you and laugh at you.
people far and near will make fun of you.
you have ruined your name.
you are filled with confusion.
“‘look, all the leaders in israel are using their strength just to kill other people.
and the people in jerusalem don’t respect their parents.
there in the city, they abuse the foreigners.
they cheat orphans and widows in that place.
you hate all that i consider holy.
you treat my special days of rest as if they are not important.
in jerusalem, people tell lies in order to kill innocent people.
they go to the mountains to worship false gods and then come back to jerusalem to eat their fellowship meals.
“‘in jerusalem, people commit many sexual sins.
there men commit sexual sins with their father’s wife.
there the men rape women—even during their monthly time of bleeding.
one man commits a terrible sin against his own neighbor’s wife.
another man has sex with his daughter-in-law and makes her unclean.
another man rapes his father’s daughter—his very own sister.
there men accept bribes to kill people.
you lend money and charge interest on the loans.
you cheat your neighbors just to make a little money.
you have even forgotten me.’ this is what the lord god said.
“‘now look!
i will slam my hand down and stop you!
i will punish you for cheating and killing people.
will you be brave then?
will you be strong at the time i come to punish you?
i am the lord.
i have spoken, and i will do what i said!
i will scatter you among the nations.
i will force you to go to many countries.
i will completely destroy the filthy things in this city.
but jerusalem, you will become unclean.
and the other nations will see all these things happen.
then you will know that i am the lord.’” 
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, bronze, iron, lead, and tin are important metals, but when a worker melts silver to make it pure, those metals are poured off as waste.
israel has become like that waste to me.
so this is what the lord god says: ‘all of you have become like worthless waste.
so i will gather you into jerusalem.
workers put silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into a fire.
they blow on the fire to make it hotter.
then the metals begin to melt.
in the same way i will put you in my fire and melt you.
that fire is my hot anger.
i will put you in my fire of anger and blow on it, and you will begin to melt.
in that city, you will be like silver melting in a fire.
then you will know that i am the lord, and that i poured out my anger on you.’” 
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, speak to israel.
tell her that she is not pure.
i am angry at that country, so that country has not received its rain.
the prophets in jerusalem are making evil plans.
they are like a lion—it roars when it begins to eat the animal it caught.
they have destroyed many lives.
they have taken many valuable things and made widows of many of the women in jerusalem.
“the priests have really hurt my teachings.
they don’t treat my holy things right—they don’t show they are important.
they treat holy things the same as things that are not holy.
they treat clean things like things that are unclean.
they don’t teach the people about these things.
they refuse to respect my special days of rest.
they treat me as though i am not important.
“the leaders in jerusalem are like a wolf eating the animal it has caught.
they attack people and kill them just to get rich.
“the prophets don’t warn the people—they cover up the truth.
they are like workers who don’t really repair a wall—they only put plaster over the holes.
they only see lies.
they do their magic to learn the future, but they only tell lies.
they say, ‘this is what the lord god said.’ but they are only lying—the lord did not speak to them!
“the common people take advantage of each other.
they cheat and steal from each other.
they get rich by taking advantage of poor, helpless beggars, and they really cheat the foreigners.
they are not fair to them at all!
“i asked the people to change their lives and protect their country.
i asked people to fix the walls.
i wanted them to stand by those holes in the wall and fight to protect their city.
but no one came to help!
so i will show them my anger—i will completely destroy them.
i will punish them for the evil things they have done.
it is all their fault.” this is what the lord god said.
chapter 13.
“a prophet or someone who explains dreams might come to you and tell you that they will show you a sign or a miracle.
and the sign or miracle they told you about might come true.
then they might ask you to follow other gods (gods you don’t know) and say to you, ‘let’s serve these gods!’ 
don’t listen to them, because the lord your god is testing you.
he wants to know if you love him with all your heart and all your soul.
you must follow the lord your god.
respect him.
obey his commands and do what he tells you.
serve the lord your god, and never leave him.
also, you must kill that prophet or person who explains dreams, because they told you to turn against the lord your god.
and it was the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt, where you were slaves.
they tried to pull you away from the life he commanded you to live, so you must kill them to remove this evil from your people.
“someone close to you might secretly persuade you to worship other gods.
it might be your own brother, your son, your daughter, the wife you love, or your closest friend.
they might say, ‘let’s go and serve other gods.’ (these are gods that you and your ancestors never knew.
they are the gods of the people who live in the other lands around you, some near and some far away.)
you must not agree with them.
don’t listen to them or feel sorry for them.
don’t let them go free or protect them.
no, you must kill them with stones.
you be the first one to pick up stones and throw at them.
then everyone must throw stones to kill them, because they tried to pull you away from the lord your god.
and it was the lord who brought you out of the land of egypt, where you were slaves.
then all the israelites will hear about it and be afraid.
and they will not do those evil things any more.
“the lord your god has given you cities to live in.
sometimes you might hear some bad news about one of these cities.
you might hear that 
some troublemakers from your own nation are persuading the people of their city to do bad things.
they might say to the people of their city, ‘let’s go and serve other gods.’ (these gods would be gods that you never knew before.)
if you hear this kind of news, you must do all you can to learn if it is true.
if you learn that it is true, if you prove that such a terrible thing really did happen, 
then you must kill all the people of that city and their animals too.
you must destroy that city completely.
you must gather up everything of value and take it to the center of the city.
burn the whole city and everything in it as a burnt offering to the lord your god.
you must turn that city into an empty pile of rocks forever, and that city must never be rebuilt.
everything in that city must be destroyed as an offering to god.
so you must not keep any of the things for yourselves.
if you follow this command, the lord will stop being so angry with you.
he will be kind to you.
he will feel sorry for you.
he will let your nation grow larger, as he promised your ancestors.
this will happen if you listen to the lord your god—if you obey all his commands that i give you today.
you must do what the lord your god says is right.
chapter 9.
then the lord told moses to go to pharaoh and tell him: “the lord, the god of the hebrews, says, ‘let my people go to worship me!’ 
if you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go, 
then the lord will use his power against your animals in the fields.
he will cause all of your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, and sheep to get sick with a terrible disease.
but the lord will treat israel’s animals differently from the animals of egypt.
none of the animals that belong to the israelites will die.
the lord has set the time for this to happen.
he said, ‘tomorrow the lord will make this happen in this country.’” 
the next morning the lord did what he said.
all the farm animals of the egyptians died, but none of the animals that belonged to the israelites died.
pharaoh sent people to see if any of the animals of israel died.
not one of them died.
but pharaoh remained stubborn and did not let the people go.
the lord said to moses and aaron, “fill your hands with the ashes from a furnace.
moses, you throw the ashes into the air in front of pharaoh.
this will become dust that will go throughout the land of egypt.
whenever the dust touches a person or an animal in egypt, sores will break out on the skin.” 
so moses and aaron took ashes from a furnace and went and stood before pharaoh.
moses threw the ashes into the air, and sores began breaking out on people and animals.
the magicians could not stop moses from doing this, because even the magicians had the sores.
this happened everywhere in egypt.
but the lord made pharaoh stubborn, so he refused to listen to moses and aaron, just as the lord had said.
then the lord said to moses, “get up in the morning and go to pharaoh.
tell him that the lord, the god of the hebrews, says, ‘let my people go to worship me!
this time, i will use my full power against you, your officials, and your people.
then you will know that there is no god in the world like me.
i could use my power and cause a disease that would wipe you and your people off the earth.
but i have put you here for a reason.
i have put you here so that i could show you my power.
then people all over the world will learn about me!
you are still against my people.
you are not letting them go free.
so at this time tomorrow, i will cause a very bad hailstorm.
there has never been a hailstorm like this in egypt, not since egypt became a nation.
now, you must put your animals in a safe place.
everything you own that is now in the fields must be put in a safe place.
any person or animal that remains in the fields will be killed.
the hail will fall on everything that is not gathered into your houses.’” 
some of pharaoh’s officials paid attention to the lord’s message.
they quickly put all of their animals and slaves into houses.
but other people ignored the lord’s message and lost all their slaves and animals that were in the fields.
the lord told moses, “raise your hand into the air and the hail will start falling all over egypt.
the hail will fall on all the people, animals, and plants in all the fields of egypt.” 
so moses raised his walking stick into the air, and the lord sent hail with thunder and lightning down on the earth.
the lord caused hail to fall all over egypt.
the hail was falling, and lightning was flashing all through it.
it was the worst hailstorm that had ever hit egypt since it had become a nation.
the storm destroyed everything in the fields in egypt.
the hail destroyed people, animals, and plants.
the hail also broke all the trees in the fields.
the only place that did not get hail was the land of goshen, where the israelites lived.
pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and told them, “this time i have sinned.
the lord is right, and i and my people are wrong.
we have had enough of this hail and thunder!
ask the lord to stop the storm, and i will let you go.
you don’t have to stay here.” 
moses told pharaoh, “when i leave the city, i will lift my hands in prayer to the lord, and the thunder and hail will stop.
then you will know that the lord is in this land.
but i know that you and your officials don’t really fear and respect the lord yet.” 
the flax had already developed its seeds, and the barley was already blooming.
so these plants were destroyed.
but wheat and spelt ripen later than the other grains, so these plants were not destroyed.
moses left pharaoh and went outside the city.
he lifted his hands in prayer to the lord.
and the thunder and hail stopped, and then even the rain stopped.
when pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he again did wrong.
he and his officials became stubborn again.
pharaoh refused to let the israelites go free, just as the lord had said through moses.
chapter 37.
jacob stayed and lived in the land of canaan.
this is the same land where his father had lived.
this is the story of jacob’s family.
joseph was a young man, 17 years old.
his job was to take care of the sheep and the goats.
joseph did this work with his brothers, the sons of bilhah and zilpah.
(bilhah and zilpah were his father’s wives.)
joseph told his father about the bad things that his brothers did.
joseph was born at a time when his father israel was very old, so israel loved him more than he loved his other sons.
jacob gave him a special coat, which was long and very beautiful.
when joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved joseph more than he loved them, they hated their brother because of this.
they refused to say nice things to him.
one time joseph had a special dream.
later, he told his brothers about this dream, and after that his brothers hated him even more.
joseph said, “i had a dream.
we were all working in the field, tying stacks of wheat together.
then my stack got up.
it stood there while all of your stacks of wheat made a circle around mine and bowed down to it.” 
his brothers said, “do you think this means that you will be a king and rule over us?” his brothers hated joseph more now because of the dreams he had about them.
then joseph had another dream, and he told his brothers about it.
he said, “i had another dream.
i saw the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me.” 
joseph also told his father about this dream, but his father criticized him.
his father said, “what kind of dream is this?
do you believe that your mother, your brothers, and i will bow down to you?” 
joseph’s brothers continued to be jealous of him, but his father thought about all these things and wondered what they could mean.
one day joseph’s brothers went to shechem to care for their father’s sheep.
jacob said to joseph, “go to shechem.
your brothers are there with my sheep.” joseph answered, “i will go.” 
his father said, “go and see if your brothers are safe.
come back and tell me if my sheep are all fine.” so joseph’s father sent him from the valley of hebron to shechem.
at shechem, joseph got lost.
a man found him wandering in the fields.
the man said, “what are you looking for?” 
joseph answered, “i am looking for my brothers.
can you tell me where they are with their sheep?” 
the man said, “they have already gone away.
i heard them say that they were going to dothan.” so joseph followed his brothers and found them in dothan.
joseph’s brothers saw him coming from far away.
they decided to make a plan to kill him.
they said to each other, “here comes joseph the dreamer.
we should kill him now while we can.
we could throw his body into one of the empty wells and tell our father that a wild animal killed him.
then we will show him that his dreams are useless.” 
but reuben wanted to save joseph.
he said, “let’s not kill him.
we can put him into a well without hurting him.” reuben planned to save joseph and send him back to his father.
when joseph came to his brothers, they attacked him and tore off his long and beautiful coat.
then they threw him into an empty well that was dry.
while joseph was in the well, the brothers sat down to eat.
they looked up and saw a group of traders traveling from gilead to egypt.
their camels were carrying many different spices and riches.
so judah said to his brothers, “what profit will we get if we kill our brother and hide his death?
we will profit more if we sell him to these traders.
then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother.” the other brothers agreed.
when the midianite traders came by, the brothers took joseph out of the well and sold him to the traders for 20 pieces of silver.
the traders took him to egypt.
reuben had been gone, but when he came back to the well, he saw that joseph was not there.
he tore his clothes to show that he was upset.
reuben went to the brothers and said, “the boy is not in the well!
what will i do?” 
the brothers killed a goat and put the goat’s blood on joseph’s beautiful coat.
then the brothers showed the coat to their father.
and the brothers said, “we found this coat.
is this joseph’s coat?” 
his father saw the coat and knew that it was joseph’s.
he said, “yes, that is his!
maybe some wild animal has killed him.
my son joseph has been eaten by a wild animal!” 
jacob was so sorry about his son that he tore his clothes.
then jacob put on special clothes to show that he was sad.
he continued to be sad about his son for a long time.
all of jacob’s sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but jacob was never comforted.
he said, “i will be sad about my son until the day i die.” so jacob continued to mourn his son joseph.
the midianite traders later sold joseph in egypt.
they sold him to potiphar, the captain of the pharaoh’s guards.
chapter 122.
a song of david for going up to the temple.
i was happy when the people said, “let us go to the lord’s temple.” 
here we are, standing at the gates of jerusalem.
this is new jerusalem!
the city has been rebuilt as one united city.
this is where the tribes come, the tribes who belong to the lord.
the people of israel come here to praise the lord’s name.
the kings from david’s family put their thrones here.
they set up their thrones to judge the people.
pray for peace in jerusalem: “may those who love you find peace.
may there be peace within your walls.
may there be safety in your great buildings.” 
for the good of my family and neighbors, i pray that there will be peace here.
for the good of the temple of the lord our god, i pray that good things will happen to this city.
chapter 12.
the men from the tribe of ephraim called all their soldiers together.
then they went across the river to the city of zaphon.
they said to jephthah, “why didn’t you call us to help you fight the ammonites?
we will burn your house down with you in it.” 
jephthah answered them, “the ammonites have been giving us many problems.
so my people and i fought against them.
i called you, but you didn’t come to help us.
i saw that you would not help us, so i risked my own life.
i went across the river to fight against the ammonites.
the lord helped me defeat them.
now why have you come to fight against me today?” 
then jephthah called the men of gilead together.
they fought against the men from the tribe of ephraim because they had insulted the men of gilead.
they had said, “you men of gilead are nothing but survivors of the men of ephraim.
part of you belongs to ephraim, and part of you belongs to manasseh.” the men of gilead defeated the men of ephraim.
the men of gilead captured the places where people cross the jordan river.
those places led to the country of ephraim.
any time a survivor from ephraim came to the river and said, “let me cross,” the men of gilead would ask him, “are you from ephraim?” if he said, “no,” 
they would say, “say the word ‘shibboleth.’” the men of ephraim could not say that word correctly.
they pronounced the word “sibboleth.” so if the man said, “sibboleth,” then the men of gilead knew he was from ephraim.
so they would kill him at the crossing place.
they killed 42,000 men from ephraim.
jephthah was a judge for the israelites for six years.
then jephthah from gilead died and was buried in his town in gilead.
after jephthah, a man named ibzan was a judge for the israelites.
ibzan was from the city of bethlehem.
ibzan had 30 sons and 30 daughters.
he told his 30 daughters to marry men who were not his relatives.
and he found 30 women who were not his relatives, and his sons married these women.
ibzan was a judge for the israelites for seven years.
then ibzan died and was buried in the city of bethlehem.
after ibzan, a man named elon was a judge for the israelites.
elon was from the tribe of zebulun.
he was a judge for the israelites for ten years.
then elon from the tribe of zebulun died and was buried in the city of aijalon in the land of zebulun.
after elon died, a man named abdon son of hillel was a judge for the israelites.
abdon was from the city of pirathon.
abdon had 40 sons and 30 grandsons.
they rode on 70 donkeys.
abdon was a judge for the israelites for eight years.
then abdon son of hillel died and was buried in the city of pirathon.
pirathon is in the land of ephraim in the hill country where the amalekites lived.
chapter 26.
in the eleventh year of exile, on the first day of the month, the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, tyre said bad things about jerusalem: ‘hurray!
the city gate protecting the people is destroyed!
the city gate is open for me.
the city of jerusalem is ruined, so i can get plenty of valuable things out of it!’” 
so the lord god says: “i am against you, tyre!
i will bring many nations to fight against you.
they will come again and again, like waves on the beach.
“the enemy soldiers will destroy the walls of tyre and pull down her towers.
i will also scrape the topsoil from her land.
i will make tyre a bare rock.
tyre will become a place by the sea for spreading fishing nets.
i have spoken!” the lord god says, “tyre will be like the valuable things soldiers take in war.
her daughters on the mainland will be killed in battle.
then they will know that i am the lord.” 
this is what the lord god says: “i will bring an enemy from the north against tyre.
that enemy is nebuchadnezzar, the great king of babylon!
he will bring a very large army.
there will be horses, chariots, horse soldiers and many other soldiers.
they will be from many different nations.
nebuchadnezzar will kill your daughters on the mainland.
he will build towers to attack your city.
he will build a dirt road around your city and a dirt road leading up to the walls.
he will bring the logs to break down your walls.
he will use picks and break down your towers.
there will be so many of his horses that the dust from them will cover you.
your walls will shake at the noise of horse soldiers, wagons, and chariots when the king of babylon enters the city through your city gates.
yes, they will come into your city because its walls will be pulled down.
the king of babylon will come riding through your city.
his horses’ hoofs will come pounding over your streets.
he will kill your people with swords.
the strong columns in your city will fall to the ground.
nebuchadnezzar’s men will take away your riches.
they will take the things you wanted to sell.
they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses.
they will throw the wood and stones into the sea like garbage.
so i will stop the sound of your happy songs.
people will not hear your harps anymore.
i will make you a bare rock.
you will be a place by the sea for spreading fishing nets!
you will not be rebuilt, because i, the lord, have spoken!” this is what the lord god said.
this is what the lord god says to tyre: “the countries along the mediterranean coast will shake at the sound of your fall.
that will happen when your people are hurt and killed.
then all the leaders of the countries by the sea will step down from their thrones and show their sadness.
they will take off their special robes and their beautiful clothes.
then they will put on their ‘clothes of shaking.’ they will sit on the ground and shake with fear.
they will be shocked at how quickly you were destroyed.
they will sing this sad song about you: “‘tyre, you were a famous city.
people came from across the sea to live in you.
you were famous, but now you are gone!
you were strong on the sea, and so were the people who lived in you.
you made all who live on the mainland afraid of you.
now, on the day you fall, the countries along the coast will shake with fear.
you started many colonies along the coast.
now those people will be afraid when you are gone!’” 
this is what the lord god says: “tyre, you will become an old, empty city.
no one will live there.
i will cause the sea to flow over you.
the great sea will cover you.
i will send you down into that deep hole—to the place of death.
you will join those who died long ago.
i will send you to the world below, like all the other old, empty cities.
you will be with all the others who go down to the grave.
no one will live in you then.
you will never again be in the land of the living!
other people will be afraid about what happened to you.
you will be finished.
people will look for you, but they will never find you again.” that is what the lord god says.
chapter 21.
“in the land that the lord your god is giving you, you might find a dead body in a field, but no one knows who killed that person.
your leaders and judges must come out and measure the distance to the towns around the dead body.
when you learn which town is nearest to the dead body, the leaders of that town must take a cow from their herds.
it must be a cow that never had a calf and that has never been used for work.
the leaders of that town must then bring the cow down to a valley with running water.
it must be a valley that has never been plowed or had anything planted in it.
then the leaders must break the cow’s neck there in that valley.
the priests, the descendants of levi, must also go there.
(the lord your god has chosen these priests to serve him and to bless people in the name of the lord.
the priests will decide who is right in every lawsuit and whenever someone is hurt.)
all the leaders of the town nearest the dead body must wash their hands over the cow that had its neck broken in the valley.
these leaders must say, ‘we did not kill this person, and we did not see it happen.
lord, you saved your people israel.
now make us pure.
don’t blame us for killing an innocent person.’ in this way these men will not be blamed for killing an innocent person.
in this way you will remove that guilt from your group by doing what the lord said.
“you might fight against your enemies, and the lord your god might let you defeat them and take them as captives.
you might see a beautiful woman among the captives who you want to be your wife.
you must then bring her into your house where she will shave her head and cut her nails.
she must change her clothes and take off the clothes she was wearing when she was captured in war.
she will stay in your house and be sad about losing her father and her mother for a full month.
after that you may go to her to be her husband, and she will be your wife.
if you are not pleased with her and choose to divorce her, set her free.
you cannot sell her.
you had sexual relations with her, so you must not treat her like a slave.
“a man might have two wives.
he might love one wife more than the other.
both wives might have children for him, but the firstborn son might be from the wife he does not love.
when the man divides his property among his children, he cannot give the rights of the firstborn to the son of his favorite wife.
the man must accept the firstborn son from the wife he does not love.
the man must give that son a double share of everything he owns because that son is his first child.
the right of the firstborn belongs to that son.
“a man might have a son who is stubborn and refuses to obey.
this son does not obey his father or mother.
they punish the son, but he still refuses to listen to them.
his father and mother must then take him to the leaders of the town at the town meeting place.
they must say to the leaders of the town: ‘our son is stubborn and refuses to obey.
he does not do anything we tell him to do.
he eats and he drinks too much.’ 
then the men in the town must kill the son with stones.
by doing this you will remove this evil from your group.
everyone in israel will hear about this and be afraid.
“a man might be guilty of a sin that must be punished by death.
people might kill him and hang his body on a tree.
you must not let that body stay on the tree overnight.
you must be sure to bury this man on the same day, because the one who hangs on a tree is cursed by god, and you must not let the land that the lord your god is giving you become unclean.
chapter 40.
in the twenty-fifth year after we were taken away into captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, the lord’s power came on me.
this was fourteen years after the babylonians took jerusalem.
on that day the lord took me there in a vision.
in a vision, god carried me to the land of israel.
he put me down near a very high mountain.
on the mountain in front of me was a building that looked like a city.
he took me to that place.
there was a man there who looked like polished bronze.
he had a cloth tape measure and a measuring rod in his hand.
he was standing by the gate.
the man said to me, “son of man, use your eyes and ears.
look at these things and listen to me.
pay attention to everything that i show you, because you have been brought here so that i can show you these things.
you must tell the family of israel all that you see.” 
i saw a wall that went all the way around the outside of the temple.
in the man’s hand there was a ruler for measuring things.
it was 6 cubits long using the long measurement, so the man measured the thickness of the wall.
it was one ruler thick.
he measured the height of the wall.
it was one ruler tall.
then the man went to the east gate.
he walked up its steps and measured the opening for the gate.
it was one ruler wide.
the guardrooms were one ruler long and one ruler wide.
the walls between the rooms were 5 cubits thick.
the opening by the porch at the end of the gateway that faced the temple was also one ruler wide.
then he measured the porch.
it was 8 cubits long.
he measured the walls on either side of the gate.
each side wall was 2 cubits wide.
the porch was at the end of the gateway that faced the temple.
there were three little guardrooms on each side of the gateway.
all these rooms and their side walls measured the same.
the man measured the entrance to the gateway.
it was 10 cubits wide and 13 cubits long.
there was a low wall in front of each room.
that wall was 1 cubit tall and 1 cubit thick.
the rooms were square.
each wall was 6 cubits long.
the man measured the gateway from the outside edge of the roof of one room to the outside edge of the roof of the opposite room.
it was 25 cubits.
each door was directly opposite the other door.
he measured the faces of all the side walls, including the side walls on either side of the porch at the courtyard.
the total was 60 cubits.
from the inside edge of the outer gate to the far end of the porch was 50 cubits.
there were small windows above all the guardrooms, the side walls, and the porch.
the wide part of the windows faced into the gateway.
there were carvings of palm trees on the walls that were on either side of the gateway.
then the man led me into the outer courtyard.
i saw thirty rooms and a pavement that went all the way around the courtyard.
the rooms were along the wall and faced in toward the pavement.
the pavement was as wide as the gates were long.
the pavement reached to the inside end of the gateway.
this was the lower pavement.
the man measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner courtyard.
it was 100 cubits on the east side as well as on the north side.
then the man measured the length and width of the north gate that was in the wall surrounding the outer courtyard.
this gateway, its three rooms on each side, and its porch all measured the same as the first gate.
the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
its windows, its porch, and its carvings of palm trees measured the same as the east gate.
on the outside, there were seven steps leading up to the gate.
its porch was at the inside end of the gateway.
across the courtyard from the north gate, there was a gate to the inner courtyard.
it was like the gate on the east.
the man measured from the gate on the inner wall to the gate on the outer wall.
it was 100 cubits from gate to gate.
then the man led me to the south wall.
i saw a gate in the south wall.
he measured its side walls and its porch.
they measured the same as the other gates.
the gateway and its porch had windows all around like the other gates.
the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
there were seven steps going up to this gate.
its porch was at the inside end of the gateway.
it had carvings of palm trees on the walls that were on either side of the gateway.
a gate was on the south side of the inner courtyard.
the man measured from the gate on the inner wall to the gate on the outer wall.
it was 100 cubits from gate to gate.
then the man led me through the south gate into the inner courtyard.
he measured this gate.
this gateway measured the same as the other gates to the inner courtyard.
its rooms, side walls, and porch also measured the same as the other gates.
there were windows all around the gateway and its porch.
the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
the porch was 25 cubits wide and 5 cubits long.
and its porch was at the end of the gateway next to the outer courtyard.
carvings of palm trees were on the walls on either side of the gateway.
there were eight steps leading up to the gate.
then the man led me into the inner courtyard on the east side.
he measured the gate.
it measured the same as the other gates.
its rooms, side walls, and porch also measured the same as the other gates.
there were windows all around the gateway and its porch.
the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
and its porch was at the end of the gateway next to the outer courtyard.
carvings of palm trees were on the walls on either side of the gateway.
there were eight steps leading up to the gate.
then the man led me to the north gate.
he measured it, and it measured the same as the other gates.
its rooms, side walls, and porch also measured the same as the other gates.
there were windows all around the gateway and its porch.
the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
and its porch was at the end of the gateway next to the outer courtyard.
carvings of palm trees were on the walls on either side of the gateway.
there were eight steps leading up to the gate.
there was also a doorway in the side walls of the gates.
that doorway led into a room where the priests washed the sacrifices.
there were two tables on each side of the door of this porch.
the animals for the burnt offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings were killed on these tables.
there were also two tables on each side of the door on the outside wall of this porch.
so there were four tables on the inside wall and four tables on the outside wall—eight tables that the priests used when they killed the animals for sacrifices.
there were also four tables made from cut stone for the burnt offerings.
these tables were 1 1/2 cubits long, 1 1/2 cubits wide, and 1 cubit high.
on these tables, the priests put their tools that they used to kill the animals for the burnt offerings and other sacrifices.
there were meat hooks three inches long on all the walls in this area.
the meat of the offerings was put on the tables.
there were two rooms in the inner courtyard.
one was by the north gate facing south.
the other room was by the south gate facing north.
the man said to me, “the room that looks to the south is for the priests who are on duty and serving in the temple area.
but the room that looks to the north is for the priests who are on duty and serving at the altar.
the priests are from the tribe of levi.
but the priests in this second group are the descendants of zadok.
they are the only people who can carry the sacrifices to the altar to serve the lord.” 
the man measured the inner courtyard.
the courtyard was a perfect square.
it was 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide.
the altar was in front of the temple.
then the man led me to the porch of the temple and measured the walls on either side of the porch.
each side wall was 5 cubits thick and 3 cubits wide.
the opening between them was 14 cubits.
the porch was 20 cubits wide and 12 cubits long.
ten steps went up to the porch.
there were two columns for the walls on either side of the porch—one at each wall.

chapter 20.
at that place there was a man named sheba son of bicri.
sheba was a worthless troublemaker from the tribe of benjamin.
he blew a trumpet to gather the people together and said, “we have no share in david.
we have no part in the son of jesse.
israel, let’s all go home.” 
so all the israelites left david and followed sheba son of bicri.
but the people from judah stayed with their king all the way from the jordan river to jerusalem.
david went back to his house in jerusalem.
he had left ten of his slave women to take care of the house.
he put these women in a special house.
then he put guards around the house.
they stayed in this house until they died.
david took care of the women and gave them food, but he did not have sexual relations with them.
they lived like widows until they died.
the king told amasa, “tell the people of judah to meet with me in three days.
you must be here, too.” 
so amasa called the people of judah together, but he took longer than the king had told him.
david said to abishai, “sheba son of bicri is more dangerous to us than absalom was.
so take my officers and chase sheba.
hurry before he gets into cities with walls.
if he gets into the well-protected cities, we will not be able to get him.” 
so joab took the kerethites and pelethites and the other soldiers with him and left jerusalem to chase after sheba son of bicri.
when joab and the army came to big rock at gibeon, amasa came out to meet them.
joab was wearing his uniform with a belt that held a knife.
as he walked toward amasa, the knife on the belt came out.
joab asked amasa, “how are you doing, brother?” joab reached out with his right hand and grabbed amasa by the beard to greet him with a kiss.
amasa didn’t see the knife that was now in joab’s other hand.
joab stabbed him in the belly, and amasa’s intestines spilled out on the ground.
there was no need for joab to stab him again; he was already dead.
then joab and his brother abishai resumed the chase after sheba son of bicri.
one of joab’s young soldiers stood by amasa’s body and said, “all of you who support joab and david, let’s follow joab.” 
amasa was there in the middle of road, lying in his own blood.
the young soldier noticed that all the people kept stopping to look at the body, so he rolled the body off the road and into the field and covered it with a cloth.
once the body was out of the way, the people simply passed it by and joined up with joab to go after sheba son of bicri.
sheba son of bicri passed through all the tribes of israel on his way to abel beth maacah.
all the berites joined together and followed sheba.
when joab and his men came to abel beth maacah, they surrounded the town.
they piled dirt up against the city wall and began breaking stones out of the wall to make it fall down.
but there was a very wise woman in that city who shouted out to them and said, “listen to me!
tell joab to come here.
i want to talk with him.” 
joab went to talk with the woman.
she asked him, “are you joab?” joab answered, “yes, i am.” then the woman said, “listen to me.” joab said, “i am listening.” 
then the woman said, “in the past people would say, ‘ask for help in abel and you will get what you need.’ 
i am one of many peaceful, loyal people in this town.
you are trying to destroy an important city of israel.
why do you want to destroy something that belongs to the lord?” 
joab answered, “i don’t want to destroy anything.
i don’t want to ruin your city.
but there is a man in your city from the hill country of ephraim.
he is named sheba son of bicri.
he rebelled against king david.
bring him to me, and i will leave the city alone.” the woman said to joab, “all right.
his head will be thrown over the wall to you.” 
then the woman spoke very wisely to all the people of the city.
they cut off the head of sheba son of bicri and threw it over the city wall to joab.
so joab blew the trumpet and the army left the city.
the soldiers went home, and joab went back to the king in jerusalem.
joab was captain of the whole army of israel.
benaiah son of jehoiada led the kerethites and pelethites.
adoniram led the men who were forced to do hard work.
jehoshaphat son of ahilud was the historian.
sheva was the secretary.
zadok and abiathar were the priests.
and ira from jair was david’s personal priest.
chapter 16.
this is the land that the family of joseph received.
this land started at the jordan river near jericho and continued to the waters of jericho.
(this was just east of jericho.)
the border went up from jericho to the hill country of bethel.
then the border continued from bethel (luz) to the arkite border at ataroth.
then the border went west to the border of the japhletites.
the border continued to lower beth horon.
then the border went to gezer and continued to the mediterranean sea.
so the people of manasseh and ephraim got their land.
(manasseh and ephraim were sons of joseph.)
this is the land that was given to the people of ephraim: their eastern border started at ataroth addar near upper beth horon.
and the western border started at micmethath.
the border turned to the east to taanath shiloh and continued east to janoah.
then it went from janoah down to ataroth and to naarah.
the border continued until it touched jericho and ended at the jordan river.
the border went from tappuah west to kanah ravine and ended at the sea.
this is all the land that was given to the ephraimites.
each family in that tribe got a part of this land.
many of the border towns of ephraim were actually in manasseh’s borders, but the ephraimites got the towns and the fields around them.
but the ephraimites were not able to force the canaanites to leave the town of gezer.
so the canaanites still live among the ephraimites today, although they did become slaves of the ephraimites.
chapter 37.
nebuchadnezzar was the king of babylon.
he appointed zedekiah son of josiah to be the king of judah in the place of jehoiachin son of jehoiakim.
but zedekiah, his servants, and the people of judah did not pay attention to the messages the lord had given to jeremiah the prophet.
king zedekiah sent jehucal son of shelemiah and the priest zephaniah son of maaseiah to jeremiah the prophet with a message.
this was the message they brought to jeremiah: “jeremiah, pray to the lord our god for us.” 
at that time jeremiah had not yet been put into prison, so he was free to go anywhere he wanted.
also at that time pharaoh’s army had marched from egypt toward judah.
the babylonian army had surrounded the city of jerusalem in order to defeat it.
then they had heard about the army from egypt marching toward them.
so the army from babylon left jerusalem to fight with the army from egypt.
this message from the lord came to jeremiah the prophet: 
“this is what the lord, the god of the people of israel, says: ‘jehucal and zephaniah, i know that king zedekiah of judah sent you to me to ask questions.
tell king zedekiah this: pharaoh’s army marched out of egypt to come here to help you against the army of babylon.
but pharaoh’s army will go back to egypt.
after that the army from babylon will come back here and attack jerusalem.
then they will capture and burn it.’ 
this is what the lord says: ‘people of jerusalem, don’t fool yourselves.
don’t say to yourselves, “the army of babylon will surely leave us alone.” they will not.
people of jerusalem, even if you could defeat all the babylonian army that is attacking you, there would still be a few wounded men left in their tents.
even those few wounded men would come out of their tents and burn jerusalem down.’” 
when the babylonian army left jerusalem to fight the army of the pharaoh of egypt, 
jeremiah wanted to travel from jerusalem to the land of benjamin.
he wanted to be there for a division of some property that belonged to his family.
but when jeremiah got to the benjamin gate of jerusalem, the captain in charge of the guards arrested him.
the captain’s name was irijah son of shelemiah.
shelemiah was the son of hananiah.
so irijah the captain arrested jeremiah and said, “jeremiah, you are leaving us to join the babylonian side.” 
jeremiah said to irijah, “that is not true!
i am not leaving to join the babylonians.” but irijah refused to listen to jeremiah.
and irijah arrested jeremiah and took him to the royal officials of jerusalem.
those officials were very angry with jeremiah.
they gave an order for jeremiah to be beaten.
then they put him in a prison.
the prison was in the house of jonathan, a scribe for the king of judah.
his house had been made into a prison.
they put jeremiah into a cell under the house of jonathan.
the cell was in a dungeon under the ground.
jeremiah was there for a long time.
then king zedekiah sent for jeremiah and had him brought to the palace.
zedekiah talked to jeremiah in private.
he asked jeremiah, “is there any message from the lord?” jeremiah answered, “yes, he said that you will be given to the king of babylon.” 
then jeremiah said to king zedekiah, “what have i done wrong?
what crime have i done against you or your officials or the people of jerusalem?
why have you thrown me into prison?
king zedekiah, where are your prophets now?
they told you a false message.
they said, ‘the king of babylon will not attack you or this land of judah.’ 
but now, my lord, king of judah, please listen to me.
please let me bring my request to you.
this is what i ask: don’t send me back to the house of jonathan the scribe.
if you send me back, i will die there.” 
so king zedekiah gave orders for jeremiah to be put under guard in the courtyard.
and he ordered that jeremiah should be given bread from the street bakers.
he was given bread until there was no more bread in the city.
so jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard.
chapter 1.
this is the message that the lord gave to zephaniah.
he received this message during the time that josiah son of amon was king of judah.
zephaniah was the son of cush, who was the son of gedaliah.
gedaliah was the son of amariah, who was the son of hezekiah.
the lord says, “i will destroy everything on earth.
i will destroy all the people and all the animals.
i will destroy the birds in the air and the fish in the sea.
i will destroy the evil people and everything that makes them sin.
i will remove all people from the earth.” this is what the lord said.
“i will punish judah and the people living in jerusalem.
i will remove from this place any signs of baal worship.
no one will remember the priests who serve the idols there.
and those who go up on their roofs to worship the stars will be forgotten.
they worship me, the lord, but they also use the name of the false god milcom to make promises.
they have turned away from me, the lord.
they have stopped following me.
they no longer ask me, the lord, for help.” 
be silent before the lord god, because the lord’s day for judging the people is coming soon.
the lord has prepared his sacrifice, and he has told his invited guests to get ready.
the lord said, “on the lord’s day of sacrifice, i will punish the king’s sons and other leaders.
i will punish all the people wearing clothes from other countries.
at that time i will punish all the people who jump over the threshold and those who fill their master’s house with lies and violence.” 
the lord also said, “at that time people will be calling for help at fish gate in jerusalem and mourning in the new part of town.
they will hear the sound of destruction in the hills around the city.
you people living in the lower part of town will cry, because all the traders and rich merchants will be destroyed.
“at that time i will take a lamp and search through jerusalem.
i will find all those who are satisfied to live their own way.
they say, ‘the lord does nothing.
he does not help, and he does not hurt!’ i will find them, and i will punish them.
then others will take their wealth and destroy their houses.
those who built houses will not live in them, and those who planted vineyards will not drink the wine from the grapes.” 
the lord’s special day for judging is coming soon!
it is near and coming fast.
people will hear very sad sounds on the lord’s special day of judgment.
even strong soldiers will cry.
the lord will show his anger at that time.
it will be a time of terrible troubles and a time of destruction.
it will be a time of darkness—a black, cloudy, and stormy day.
it will be like a time of war when people hear horns and trumpets in the defense towers and protected cities.
the lord said, “i will make life very hard on the people.
they will walk around like the blind who don’t know where they are going.
that will happen because they sinned against the lord.
their blood will be spilled on the ground.
their dead bodies will lie like dung on the ground.
their gold and silver will not help them!
at that time the lord will become very upset and angry.
the lord will destroy the whole world!
he will completely destroy everyone on earth!” 
exodus.

aaron and his sons will make sure this lamp is burning before the lord every day from evening until morning.
the israelites and their descendants must obey this law forever.
chapter 2.
during nebuchadnezzar’s second year as king, he had dreams.
they bothered him, and he could not sleep.
so the king called his wise men to come to him.
they used magic and watched the stars.
they did this to try to interpret dreams and to learn what would happen in the future.
the king wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed, so they came in and stood in front of him.
then the king said to them, “i had a dream that bothers me.
i want to know what it means.” 
then the chaldeans answered the king.
they spoke aramaic and said, “king, live forever!
please tell your dream to us, your servants, and then we will tell you what it means.” 
then king nebuchadnezzar said to them, “no, you must tell me the dream, and then you must tell me what it means.
if you don’t, i will give an order for you to be cut into pieces.
and i will order your houses to be destroyed until they are nothing but piles of dust and ashes.
but if you tell me my dream and explain its meaning, i will give you gifts, rewards, and great honor.
so tell me about my dream and what it means.” 
again the wise men said to the king, “please, sir, tell us about the dream, and we will tell you what it means.” 
then king nebuchadnezzar answered, “i know that you are trying to get more time.
you know that i meant what i said.
you know that you will be punished if you don’t tell me about my dream.
so you have all agreed to lie to me.
you are hoping for more time so that i will forget what i want you to do.
now tell me the dream.
if you can tell me the dream, i will know that you can tell me what it really means.” 
the chaldeans answered the king.
they said, “there is not a man on earth who can do what the king is asking!
no king has ever asked the wise men, the men who do magic, or the chaldeans to do something like this.
not even the greatest and most powerful king has ever asked his wise men to do such a thing.
the king is asking something that is too hard to do.
only the gods could tell the king his dream and what it means.
but the gods don’t live with people.” 
when the king heard that, he became very angry.
so he gave an order for all the wise men of babylon to be killed.
king nebuchadnezzar’s order to kill all the wise men was announced.
the king’s men were sent to look for daniel and his friends to kill them.
arioch was the commander of the king’s guards.
he was going to kill the wise men of babylon, but daniel talked to him.
daniel spoke politely to arioch 
and said, “why did the king order such a severe punishment?” then arioch explained the whole story about the king’s dreams, and daniel understood.
when daniel heard the story, he went to king nebuchadnezzar.
daniel asked the king to give him some more time.
then he would tell the king what the dream meant.
so daniel went to his house.
he explained the whole story to his friends hananiah, mishael, and azariah.
daniel asked his friends to pray to the god of heaven that god would be kind to them and help them understand this secret.
then daniel and his friends would not be killed with the other wise men of babylon.
during the night, god explained the secret to daniel in a vision.
then daniel praised the god of heaven.
he said, “praise god’s name forever and ever!
power and wisdom belong to him.
he changes the times and seasons.
he gives power to kings, and he takes their power away.
he gives wisdom to people, so they become wise.
he lets people learn things and become wise.
he knows hidden secrets that are hard to understand.
light lives with him, so he knows what is in the dark and secret places.
god of my ancestors, i thank you and praise you.
you gave me wisdom and power.
you told us what we asked for.
you told us about the king’s dream.” 
then daniel went to arioch, the man who king nebuchadnezzar had chosen to kill the wise men of babylon.
daniel said to arioch, “don’t kill the wise men of babylon.
take me to the king.
i will tell him what his dream means.” 
so very quickly, arioch took daniel to the king.
arioch said to the king, “i have found a man among the captives from judah who can tell the king what his dream means.” 
the king asked daniel (belteshazzar) a question.
he said, “are you able to tell me about my dream, and what it means?” 
daniel answered, “king nebuchadnezzar, no wise man, no man who does magic, and no chaldean could tell the king the secret things he has asked about.
but there is a god in heaven who tells secret things.
god has given king nebuchadnezzar dreams to show him what will happen later.
this was your dream, and this is what you saw while lying on your bed: 
king, as you were lying there on your bed, you began thinking about what might happen in the future.
god can tell people about secret things—he has shown you what will happen in the future.
god also told this secret to me, not because i have greater wisdom than other men, but so that you, king, may know what it means.
in that way you will understand what went through your mind.
“king, in your dream you saw a large statue in front of you that was very large and shiny.
it was very impressive.
the head of the statue was made from pure gold.
its chest and the arms were made from silver.
the belly and upper part of the legs were made from bronze.
the lower part of the legs was made from iron.
its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay.
while you were looking at the statue, you saw a rock that was cut loose, but not by human hands.
then the rock hit the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.
then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold broke to pieces all at the same time.
and all the pieces became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summertime.
the wind blew them away, and there was nothing left.
no one could tell that a statue had ever been there.
then the rock that hit the statue became a very large mountain and filled up the whole earth.
“that was your dream.
now we will tell the king what it means.
king, you are the most important king.
the god of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory.
he has given you control, and you rule over people and the wild animals and the birds.
wherever they live, god has made you ruler over them all.
king nebuchadnezzar, you are that head of gold on the statue.
“another kingdom will come after you, but it will not be as great as your kingdom.
next, a third kingdom will rule over the earth—that is the bronze part.
then there will be a fourth kingdom.
that kingdom will be strong like iron.
just as iron breaks things and smashes them to pieces, that fourth kingdom will break all the other kingdoms and smash them to pieces.
“you saw that the feet and toes of the statue were partly clay and partly iron.
that means the fourth kingdom will be a divided kingdom.
it will have some of the strength of iron in it just as you saw the iron mixed with clay.
the toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay.
so the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly weak like clay.
you saw the iron mixed with clay, but iron and clay don’t completely mix together.
in the same way the people of the fourth kingdom will be a mixture.
they will not be united as one people.
“during the time of the kings of the fourth kingdom, the god of heaven will set up another kingdom that will continue forever.
it will never be destroyed.
and it will be the kind of kingdom that cannot be passed on to another group of people.
this kingdom will crush all the other kingdoms.
it will bring them to an end, but that kingdom itself will continue forever.
“king nebuchadnezzar, you saw a rock cut from a mountain, but no one cut that rock.
the rock broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold to pieces.
in this way god showed you what will happen in the future.
the dream is true, and you can trust that this is what it means.” 
then king nebuchadnezzar bowed down in front of daniel to honor him.
the king praised him.
he gave an order that an offering and incense be given to honor daniel.
then the king said to daniel, “i know for sure your god is the god over all gods and the lord over all kings.
he tells people about things they cannot know.
i know this is true because you were able to tell these secret things to me.” 
then the king gave daniel a very important job in his kingdom and gave him many expensive gifts.
nebuchadnezzar made daniel ruler over the whole province of babylon and put him in charge of all the wise men of babylon.
daniel asked the king to make shadrach, meshach, and abednego important officials over the province of babylon.
the king did as daniel asked.
daniel himself became one of the important officials who was always near the king.
2 kings.
chapter 23.
king josiah told all the leaders of judah and jerusalem to come and meet with him.
then the king went up to the lord’s temple.
all the people of judah and the people who lived in jerusalem went with him.
the priests, the prophets, and all the people—from the least important to the most important—went with him.
then he read the book of the agreement.
this was the book of the law that was found in the lord’s temple.
josiah read the book so that all the people could hear it.
the king stood by the column and made an agreement with the lord.
he promised to follow the lord and to obey his commands, the laws, and his rules.
he promised to do this with all his heart and soul.
he promised to obey the agreement written in this book.
all the people stood to show that they promised to follow the agreement.
then the king commanded hilkiah the high priest, the other priests, and the gatekeepers to bring out of the lord’s temple all the dishes and things that were made to honor baal, asherah, and the stars of heaven.
then josiah burned those things outside jerusalem in the fields in kidron valley.
then they carried the ashes to bethel.
the kings of judah had chosen some ordinary men to serve as priests.
these false priests were burning incense at the high places in every city of judah and all the towns around jerusalem.
they burned incense to honor baal, the sun, the moon, the constellations, and all the stars in the sky.
but josiah stopped those false priests.
josiah removed the asherah pole from the lord’s temple.
he took the asherah pole outside the city to the kidron valley and burned it there.
then he beat the burned pieces into dust and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.
then king josiah broke down the houses of the male prostitutes who were in the lord’s temple.
women also used these houses and made little tent covers to honor the false goddess asherah.
at that time the priests did not bring the sacrifices to jerusalem and offer them on the lord’s altar in the temple.
the priests lived in cities all over judah.
they burned incense and offered sacrifices at the high places in those cities.
the high places were everywhere, from geba to beersheba.
and the priests ate their unleavened bread in those towns with the ordinary people—not at the special place for priests in the temple in jerusalem.
but king josiah ruined the high places and brought the priests to jerusalem.
josiah also destroyed the high places that were on the left side of the city gate, by the gate of joshua.
(joshua was the ruler of the city.)
topheth was a place in the valley of hinnom’s son where people killed their children and burned them on an altar to honor the false god molech.
josiah ruined that place so that no one could use it again.
in the past the kings of judah had put some horses and a chariot near the entrance to the lord’s temple.
this was near the room of an important official named nathan melech.
the horses and chariot were to honor the sun god.
josiah removed the horses and burned the chariot.
in the past the kings of judah had built altars on the roof of ahab’s building.
king manasseh had also built altars in the two courtyards of the lord’s temple.
josiah destroyed all the altars and threw the broken pieces into the kidron valley.
in the past king solomon built some high places on destroyer hill near jerusalem.
the high places were on the south side of that hill.
king solomon built one of these places of worship to honor ashtoreth, that horrible thing the people of sidon worship.
he also built one to honor chemosh, that horrible thing the moabites worship.
and king solomon built one high place to honor milcom, that horrible thing the ammonites worship.
but king josiah ruined all these places of worship.
he broke all the memorial stones and asherah poles.
then he scattered dead men’s bones over that place.
josiah also broke down the altar and high place at bethel.
jeroboam son of nebat had made this altar.
jeroboam caused israel to sin.
josiah broke down both that altar and the high place.
he broke the stones of the altar to pieces.
then he beat it into dust and he burned the asherah pole.
josiah looked around and saw graves on the mountain.
he sent men, and they took the bones from the graves.
then he burned the bones on the altar.
in this way josiah ruined the altar.
this happened according to the message from the lord that the man of god announced.
the man of god announced these things when jeroboam stood beside the altar at the feast.
then josiah looked around and saw the grave of the man of god.
josiah said, “what is that monument i see?” the people of the city told him, “it is the grave of the man of god who came from judah.
this man of god told about the things you have done to the altar at bethel.
he said them a long time ago.” 
josiah said, “leave the man of god alone.
don’t move his bones.” so they left his bones and the bones of the man of god from samaria.
josiah also destroyed all the temples at the high places in the cities of samaria.
the kings of israel had built those temples, which had made the lord very angry.
josiah destroyed them, just as he had destroyed the place of worship at bethel.
josiah killed all the priests of the high places that were in samaria.
he killed the priests on those altars and burned men’s bones on the altars so that they could never be used again.
then he went back to jerusalem.
then king josiah gave a command to all the people.
he said, “celebrate the passover for the lord your god.
do this just as it is written in the book of the agreement.” 
the people had not celebrated a passover like this since the days when the judges ruled israel.
none of the kings of israel or the kings of judah ever had such a big celebration for passover.
they celebrated this passover for the lord in jerusalem during josiah’s 18th year as king.
josiah destroyed the mediums, wizards, the house gods, the idols, and all the horrible things people worshiped in judah and jerusalem.
he did this to obey the law written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the lord’s temple.
there had never been a king like josiah before.
josiah turned to the lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength.
no king had followed all the law of moses like josiah.
and there has never been another king like josiah since that time.
but the lord did not stop being angry with the people of judah.
he was still angry with them for everything that manasseh had done.
the lord said, “i forced the israelites to leave their land.
i will do the same to judah.
i will take judah out of my sight.
i will not accept jerusalem.
yes, i chose that city.
i was talking about jerusalem when i said, ‘my name will be there.’ but i will destroy the temple that is in that place.” 
all the other things that josiah did are written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
while josiah was king, pharaoh neco, the king of egypt, went to fight against the king of assyria at the euphrates river.
josiah went out to meet neco at megiddo.
pharaoh saw josiah and killed him.
josiah’s officers put his body in a chariot and carried him from megiddo to jerusalem.
they buried josiah in his own grave.
then the common people took josiah’s son jehoahaz and anointed him.
they made jehoahaz the new king.
jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king.
he ruled three months in jerusalem.
his mother’s name was hamutal, daughter of jeremiah from libnah.
jehoahaz did what the lord said was wrong.
he did all the same things that his ancestors had done.
pharaoh neco put jehoahaz in prison at riblah in the land of hamath.
so jehoahaz could not rule in jerusalem.
pharaoh neco forced judah to pay 7500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold.
pharaoh neco made josiah’s son eliakim the new king.
eliakim took the place of josiah his father.
pharaoh neco changed eliakim’s name to jehoiakim.
and pharaoh neco took jehoahaz away to egypt where he died.
jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh.
but jehoiakim made the common people pay taxes and used that money to give to pharaoh neco.
so everyone paid their share of silver and gold, and king jehoiakim gave the money to pharaoh neco.
jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king.
he ruled eleven years in jerusalem.
his mother’s name was zebidah daughter of pedaiah from rumah.
jehoiakim did what the lord said was wrong.
he did all the same things his ancestors had done.
chapter 3.
the lord all-powerful says, “i am sending my messenger to prepare the way for me.
then suddenly, the lord you are looking for will come to his temple.
yes, the messenger you are waiting for, the one who will tell about my agreement, is really coming!
“no one can prepare for that time or stand against him when he comes.
he will be like a burning fire.
he will be like the strong soap people use to make things clean.
he will make the levites clean.
he will make them pure, like silver is made pure with fire!
he will make them pure like gold and silver.
then they will bring gifts to the lord, and they will do things the right way.
then the lord will accept the gifts from judah and jerusalem.
it will be as it was in the past—as the time long ago.
then i will bring you to justice.
i will be an expert witness and testify about the evil things people do.
i will speak out against those who do evil magic or commit adultery.
i will speak out against those who make false promises and cheat their workers and don’t pay them the money they promised.
i will testify against those who don’t help strangers, or widows and orphans.
and i will testify against those who don’t respect me.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“i am the lord, and i don’t change.
you are jacob’s children, and you have not been completely destroyed.
but you never obeyed my laws.
even your ancestors stopped following me.
come back to me, and i will come back to you.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“you say, ‘how can we come back?’ 
“people should not steal things from god, but you stole things from me.
“you say, ‘what did we steal from you?’ “you should have given me one-tenth of your things.
you should have given me special gifts.
in this way your whole nation has stolen things from me, so bad things are happening to you.” 
the lord all-powerful says, “try this test.
bring one-tenth of your things to me.
put them in the treasury.
bring food to my house.
test me!
if you do these things, i will surely bless you.
good things will come to you like rain falling from the sky.
you will have more than enough of everything.
i will not let pests destroy your crops.
all your grapevines will produce grapes.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“people from other nations will be good to you.
you will have a wonderful country.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
the lord says, “you said cruel things to me.” but you ask, “what did we say about you?” 
you said, “it is useless to worship god.
we did what the lord all-powerful told us, but we didn’t gain anything.
we cried like people at a funeral to show we were sorry for our sins, but it didn’t help.
we think proud people are happy.
evil people succeed.
they do evil things to test god’s patience, and god does not punish them.” 
then the lord’s followers spoke with each other, and the lord listened to them.
there is a book in front of him.
in that book are the names of his followers.
they are the people who honor the lord’s name.
the lord said, “they belong to me.
i will be kind to them.
parents are very kind to their children who obey them.
in the same way i will be kind to my followers.
you people will come back to me, and you will learn the difference between good and evil.
you will learn the difference between someone who follows god and someone who does not.
chapter 1.
god created the sky and the earth.
at first, 
the earth was completely empty.
there was nothing on the earth.
darkness covered the ocean, and god’s spirit moved over the water.
then god said, “let there be light!” and light began to shine.
he saw the light, and he knew that it was good.
then he separated the light from the darkness.
god named the light “day,” and he named the darkness “night.” there was evening, and then there was morning.
this was the first day.
then god said, “let there be a space to separate the water into two parts!” 
so god made the space and separated the water.
some of the water was above it, and some of the water was below it.
god named that space “sky.” there was evening, and then there was morning.
this was the second day.
then god said, “let the water under the sky be gathered together so that the dry land will appear.” and it happened.
god named the dry land “earth,” and he named the water that was gathered together “seas.” and god saw that this was good.
then god said, “let the earth grow grass, plants that make grain, and fruit trees.
the fruit trees will make fruit with seeds in it.
and each plant will make its own kind of seed.
let these plants grow on the earth.” and it happened.
the earth grew grass and plants that made grain.
and it grew trees that made fruit with seeds in it.
every plant made its own kind of seeds.
and god saw that this was good.
there was evening, and then there was morning.
this was the third day.
then god said, “let there be lights in the sky.
these lights will separate the days from the nights.
they will be used for signs to show when special meetings begin and to show the days and years.
they will be in the sky to shine light on the earth.” and it happened.
so god made the two large lights.
he made the larger light to rule during the day and the smaller light to rule during the night.
he also made the stars.
god put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth.
he put them in the sky to rule over the day and over the night.
they separated the light from the darkness.
and god saw that this was good.
there was evening, and then there was morning.
this was the fourth day.
then god said, “let the water be filled with many living things, and let there be birds to fly in the air over the earth.” 
so god created the large sea animals.
he created all the many living things in the sea and every kind of bird that flies in the air.
and god saw that this was good.
god blessed all the living things in the sea and told them to have many babies and fill the seas.
and he blessed the birds on land and told them to have many more babies.
there was evening, and then there was morning.
this was the fifth day.
then god said, “let the earth produce many kinds of living things.
let there be many different kinds of animals.
let there be large animals and small crawling animals of every kind.
and let all these animals produce more animals.” and all these things happened.
so god made every kind of animal.
he made the wild animals, the tame animals, and all the small crawling things.
and god saw that this was good.
then god said, “now let’s make humans who will be like us.
they will rule over all the fish in the sea and the birds in the air.
they will rule over all the large animals and all the little things that crawl on the earth.” 
so god created humans in his own image.
he created them to be like himself.
he created them male and female.
god blessed them and said to them, “have many children.
fill the earth and take control of it.
rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the air.
rule over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 
god said, “i am giving you all the grain bearing plants and all the fruit trees.
these trees make fruit with seeds in it.
this grain and fruit will be your food.
and i am giving all the green plants to the animals.
these green plants will be their food.
every animal on earth, every bird in the air, and all the little things that crawl on the earth will eat that food.” and all these things happened.
god looked at everything he had made.
and he saw that everything was very good.
there was evening, and then there was morning.
this was the sixth day.

chapter 4.
boaz went to the place where people gather near the city gates.
he sat there until the close relative he had told ruth about passed by.
boaz called to him, “come and sit here, friend.” 
boaz also gathered ten of the elders of the city.
he told them, “sit here!” so they sat down.
then boaz spoke to naomi’s close relative.
he said, “naomi came back from the hill country of moab.
she wants to sell the land that belonged to our relative elimelech.
i decided to tell you about this in front of the people living here and in front of the elders of our people.
if you want to pay the widow for the land and keep it in the family, then pay her for it.
if you don’t want to buy the land, tell me, because i am the next one in the family who has the right to buy it.
if you don’t buy the land from her, i will.” naomi’s closest relative said, “i will buy the land from her.” 
then boaz said, “if you buy the land from her, you must also marry the dead man’s wife, ruth, the moabite woman.
then the first child will get the land, and it will stay in the dead man’s family.” 
the close relative answered, “then i cannot buy the land.
if i do, i might lose my own land.
so i cannot do it.
you buy the land.” 
then he gave boaz something to show that he was serious.
during that time in israel, when people bought property, one person took off a sandal and gave it to the other person.
this was like signing an agreement.
so when the close relative said to boaz, “you buy the land,” he took off his sandal and gave it to boaz.
then boaz said to the elders and all the people, “you are witnesses today that i am buying from naomi everything that belonged to elimelech, kilion, and mahlon.
i also take ruth to be my wife.
then the dead man’s property will continue to belong to his family.
and he will always be remembered by his family and the people in his hometown.
you are all witnesses of what i am doing today.” 
so all the elders and the people who were near the city gates said, “we are witnesses to all of this.
and may the lord bless this woman who is coming into your home to be like rachel and leah.
they are the ones who had many children to make the people of israel strong.
and may you become powerful in the tribe of ephrathah and famous in bethlehem!
may the lord bless you with many children through ruth.
may your family become great like the family of perez, the son tamar bore for judah.” 
so boaz married ruth.
the lord allowed ruth to become pregnant, and she had a son.
the women there said to naomi, “praise the lord who gave you this child.
may he become famous in israel.
he will make you alive again and care for you in your old age.
your daughter-in-law made it happen because she bore this child for you.
she loves you, and she is better for you than seven sons.” 
naomi took the boy, held him in her arms, and cared for him.
the neighbors gave the boy his name.
these women said, “naomi has a son now!” they named him obed.
obed was the father of jesse, and jesse was the father of david.
this is the family history of perez: perez was the father of hezron.
hezron was the father of ram.
ram was the father of amminadab.
amminadab was the father of nahshon.
nahshon was the father of salmon.
salmon was the father of boaz.
boaz was the father of obed.
obed was the father of jesse.
jesse was the father of david.
chapter 101.
a song of david.
i will sing about love and justice.
lord, i will sing to you.
i will be careful to live a pure life.
i will live in my house with complete honesty.
when will you come to me?
i will not even look at anything shameful.
i hate all wrongdoing.
i want no part of it!
i will not be involved in anything dishonest.
i will have nothing to do with evil.
i will stop anyone who secretly says bad things about a neighbor.
i will not allow people to be proud and think they are better than others.
i will look throughout the land for those who can be trusted.
only such people can live with me.
only those who live pure lives can be my servants.
i will never let a dishonest person live in my house.
i will not let liars stay near me.
my goal each day will be to destroy the wicked living in our land.
i will force all who do evil to leave the city of the lord.
chapter 35.
moses gathered all the israelites together and said to them, “i will tell you what the lord has commanded you to do: 
“there are six days for working, but the seventh day will be a very special day of rest for you.
you will honor the lord by resting on that special day.
anyone who works on the seventh day must be killed.
on the sabbath you should not even light a fire in any of the places where you live.” 
moses said to all the israelites, “this is what the lord commanded: 
gather special gifts for the lord.
each of you should decide in your heart what you will give.
and then you should bring that gift to the lord.
bring gold, silver, and bronze; 
blue, purple, and red yarn and fine linen; goat hair; 
ram skins dyed red and fine leather; acacia wood; 
oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and spices for the sweet-smelling incense.
also, bring onyx stones and other jewels to be put on the ephod and the judgment pouch.
“all of you who are skilled workers should make all the things the lord commanded: 
the holy tent, its outer tent, and its covering; the hooks, boards, braces, posts, and bases; 
the holy box, its poles, the mercy-cover, and the curtain that covers the area where the box stays; 
the table and its poles, all the things on the table, and the special bread on the table; 
the lampstand that is used for light and the things used with the lampstand, the lamps, and oil for the light; 
the altar for burning incense and its poles; the anointing oil and the sweet-smelling incense; the curtain that covers the door at the entrance to the holy tent; 
the altar for burning offerings and its bronze grating, the poles, and all the things used at the altar; the bronze bowl and its base; 
the curtains around the yard, their posts and bases, and the curtain that covers the entrance to the yard; 
the pegs used to support the tent and the wall of curtains around the courtyard, and the ropes that tie to the pegs; 
and the special woven clothes for the priest to wear in the holy place.
these are the special clothes for aaron the priest and his sons to wear when they serve as priests.” 
then all the israelites went away from moses.
all the people who wanted to give came and brought a gift to the lord.
these gifts were used for making the meeting tent, everything in the tent, and the special clothes.
all the men and women who wanted to give brought gold jewelry of all kinds.
they brought pins, earrings, rings, and other jewelry.
they all gave their jewelry as a special offering to the lord.
everyone who had fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn brought it to the lord.
anyone who had goat hair or ram skins dyed red or fine leather brought it to the lord.
everyone who wanted to give silver or bronze brought that as a gift to the lord.
everyone who had acacia wood came and gave it to the lord.
every skilled woman made fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn.
and all the women who were skilled and wanted to help made cloth from the goat hair.
the leaders brought onyx stones and other jewels.
these stones and jewels were put on the ephod and judgment pouch of the priest.
the people also brought spices and olive oil.
these things were used for the sweet-smelling incense, the anointing oil, and the oil for the lamps.
all the israelites who wanted to help brought gifts to the lord.
they gave these gifts freely, because they wanted to.
these gifts were used to make everything the lord had commanded moses and the people to make.
then moses said to the israelites, “look, the lord has chosen bezalel son of uri, from the tribe of judah.
(uri was the son of hur.)
and he has filled bezalel with the spirit of god—he gave bezalel special skill and knowledge to do all kinds of things.
he can design and make things with gold, silver, and bronze.
he can cut and set stones and jewels.
he can work with wood and make all kinds of things.
the lord has given bezalel and oholiab special skills to teach other people.
(oholiab was the son of ahisamach from the tribe of dan.)
he has given both of these men special skills to do all kinds of work.
they are able to do the work of carpenters and metalworkers.
they can weave cloth with designs in it from blue, purple, and red yarn and fine linen.
and they are able to weave things with wool.
chapter 6.
then the lord said to moses, “now you will see what i will do to pharaoh.
i will use my great power against him, and he will let my people go.
he will be so ready for them to leave that he will force them to go.” 
then god said to moses, “i am the lord.
i appeared to abraham, isaac, and jacob.
they called me god all-powerful.
they did not know my name, the lord.
i made an agreement with them.
i promised to give them the land of canaan.
they lived in that land, but it was not their own.
now, i have heard their painful cries.
i know that they are slaves in egypt.
and i remember my agreement.
so tell the israelites that i say to them, ‘i am the lord.
i will save you.
you will no longer be slaves of the egyptians.
i will use my great power to make you free, and i will bring terrible punishment to the egyptians.
you will be my people and i will be your god.
i am the lord your god, and you will know that i made you free from egypt.
i made a great promise to abraham, isaac, and jacob.
i promised to give them a special land.
so i will lead you to that land.
i will give you that land.
it will be yours.
i am the lord.’” 
so moses told this to the israelites, but the people would not listen to him.
they were working so hard that they were not patient with moses.
then the lord said to moses, 
“go tell pharaoh that he must let the israelites leave his land.” 
but moses answered, “lord, the israelites refuse to listen to me.
so surely pharaoh will also refuse to listen.
i am a very bad speaker.” 
but the lord talked with moses and aaron and commanded them to go and talk to the israelites and to pharaoh, the king of egypt.
he commanded them to lead the israelites out of the land of egypt.
these are the names of the leaders of the families of israel: israel’s first son, reuben, had four sons.
they were hanoch, pallu, hezron, and carmi.
simeon’s sons were jemuel, jamin, ohad, jakin, zohar, and shaul.
(shaul was the son from a canaanite woman).
levi lived 137 years.
his sons were gershon, kohath, and merari.
gershon had two sons, libni and shimei.
kohath lived 133 years.
his sons were amram, izhar, hebron, and uzziel.
merari’s sons were mahli and mushi.
all these families were from israel’s son levi.
amram lived 137 years.
he married his father’s sister, jochebed.
amram and jochebed gave birth to aaron and moses.
izhar’s sons were korah, nepheg, and zicri.
uzziel’s sons were mishael, elzaphan, and sithri.
aaron married elisheba.
(elisheba was the daughter of amminadab, and the sister of nahshon.)
aaron and elisheba gave birth to nadab, abihu, eleazar, and ithamar.
the sons of korah (that is, the ancestors of the korahites) were assir, elkanah, and abiasaph.
aaron’s son, eleazar, married a daughter of putiel.
she gave birth to phinehas.
all these people were from israel’s son, levi.
aaron and moses were from this tribe.
and they are the men the lord spoke to and said, “lead my people out of israel in groups.” 
aaron and moses are the men who talked to pharaoh, the king of egypt, and told him to let the israelites leave egypt.
the lord spoke to moses again in the land of egypt.
he said, “i am the lord.
tell the king of egypt everything i tell you.” 
but moses, standing there before the lord, said, “you know me.
i’m a very bad speaker.
how will i make the king listen to me?” 
1 chronicles.
chapter 24.
these were the groups of aaron’s sons: aaron’s sons were nadab, abihu, eleazar, and ithamar.
but nadab and abihu died before their father did.
nadab and abihu had no sons, so eleazar and ithamar served as the priests.
david separated the tribes of eleazar and ithamar into two different groups.
he did this so that these groups could do the duties of work they were given to do.
david did this with the help of zadok and ahimelech.
zadok was a descendant of eleazar, and ahimelech was a descendant of ithamar.
there were more leaders from eleazar’s family than from ithamar’s.
there were 16 leaders from eleazar’s family and there were eight leaders from ithamar’s family.
men were chosen from each family.
they were chosen by throwing lots.
some of the men were chosen to be in charge of the holy place.
and other men were chosen to serve as priests.
all these men were from the families of eleazar and ithamar.
shemaiah was the secretary.
he was nethanel’s son.
shemaiah was from the tribe of levi.
shemaiah wrote the names of those descendants.
he wrote their names in front of king david and these leaders: zadok the priest, ahimelech, and the leaders from the families of the priests and of the levites.
ahimelech was abiathar’s son.
each time they threw the lots a man was chosen, and shemaiah wrote down that man’s name.
so they divided the work among groups of men from the families of eleazar and ithamar.
the first was jehoiarib’s group.
the second was jedaiah’s group.
the third was harim’s group.
the fourth was seorim’s group.
the fifth was malkijah’s group.
the sixth was mijamin’s group.
the seventh was hakkoz’s group.
the eighth was abijah’s group.
the ninth was jeshua’s group.
the tenth was shecaniah’s group.
the eleventh was eliashib’s group.
the twelfth was jakim’s group.
the thirteenth was huppah’s group.
the fourteenth was jeshebeab’s group.
the fifteenth was bilgah’s group.
the sixteenth was immer’s group.
the seventeenth was hezir’s group.
the eighteenth was happizzez’s group.
the nineteenth was pethahiah’s group.
the twentieth was jehezkel’s group.
the twenty-first was jakin’s group.
the twenty-second was gamul’s group.
the twenty-third was delaiah’s group.
the twenty-fourth was maaziah’s group.
these were the groups chosen to serve in the lord’s temple.
they obeyed aaron’s rules for serving in the temple.
the lord, the god of israel, had given them to aaron.
these are the names of the rest of levi’s descendants: shubael was a descendant of amram.
jehdeiah was a descendant of shubael.
isshiah was the oldest son of rehabiah.
from the izhar family group there was shelomoth.
jahath was a descendant of shelomoth.
jeriah was the oldest son of hebron.
amariah was hebron’s second son.
jahaziel was his third son, and jekameam was his fourth son.
uzziel’s son was micah.
micah’s son was shamir.
isshiah was micah’s brother.
isshiah’s son was zechariah.
merari’s descendants were mahli, mushi, and jaaziah his son.
jaaziah son of merari had sons named shoham, zaccur, and ibri.
mahli’s son was eleazar, but eleazar did not have sons.
kish’s son was jerahmeel.
mushi’s sons were mahli, eder, and jerimoth.
these are the leaders of the levite families.
they are listed by their families.
they were chosen for special jobs by throwing lots, like their relatives, the priests.
the priests were aaron’s descendants.
they threw lots in front of king david, zadok, ahimelech, and the leaders of the priests’ and levite families.
the older families and the younger families were treated the same when their jobs were chosen.
chapter 39.
at that time merodach baladan son of baladan was king of babylon.
he sent some men with letters and a gift to hezekiah when he heard that hezekiah had been sick.
this made hezekiah very happy, so he showed them all the valuable things in his storehouses.
he showed them the silver, the gold, the spices, and the expensive perfumes.
he showed them the building where he stored the weapons.
he showed them everything in his treasuries and everything in his house and throughout his kingdom.
then isaiah the prophet went to king hezekiah and asked him, “what did these men say?
where did they come from?” hezekiah said, “these men came all the way from babylon just to see me.” 
so isaiah asked him, “what did they see in your house?” hezekiah said, “they saw everything in my palace.
i showed them all my wealth.” 
then isaiah said to hezekiah, “listen to this message from the lord all-powerful: 
‘the time is coming when everything in your house and everything your ancestors have saved until today will be carried away to babylon.
nothing will be left!’ the lord all-powerful said this.
the babylonians will take your own sons, and your sons will become officers in the palace of the king of babylon.” 
then hezekiah told isaiah, “this message from the lord is good.” (hezekiah said this because he thought, “there will be real peace and security during my lifetime.”) 
genesis.
chapter 30.
rachel saw that she was not giving jacob any children.
she became jealous of her sister leah.
so rachel said to jacob, “give me children, or i will die!” 
jacob became angry with rachel and said, “i am not god.
he is the one who has caused you to not have children.” 
then rachel said, “you can have my maid bilhah.
sleep with her, and she will have a child for me.
then i can be a mother through her.” 
so rachel gave bilhah to her husband jacob.
he had sexual relations with bilhah.
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for jacob.
rachel said, “god has listened to my prayer.
he decided to give me a son.” so she named this son dan.
bilhah became pregnant again and gave jacob a second son.
rachel said, “i have fought hard to compete with my sister, and i have won.” so she named that son naphtali.
leah saw that she could have no more children.
so she gave her slave girl zilpah to jacob.
then zilpah had a son.
leah said, “i am lucky.” so she named the son gad.
zilpah gave birth to another son.
leah said, “i am very happy!
now women will call me happy.” so she named that son asher.
during the wheat harvest reuben went into the fields and found some special flowers.
he brought them to his mother leah.
but rachel said to leah, “please give me some of your son’s flowers.” 
leah answered, “you have already taken away my husband.
now you are trying to take away my son’s flowers.” but rachel answered, “if you will give me your son’s flowers, you can sleep with jacob tonight.” 
jacob came in from the fields that night.
leah saw him and went out to meet him.
she said, “you will sleep with me tonight.
i have paid for you with my son’s flowers.” so jacob slept with leah that night.
then god allowed leah to become pregnant again.
she gave birth to a fifth son.
she said, “god has given me a reward because i gave my slave to my husband.” so she named her son issachar.
leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son.
she said, “god has given me a fine gift.
now surely jacob will accept me, because i have given him six sons.” so she named this son zebulun.
later, leah gave birth to a daughter.
she named her dinah.
then god heard rachel’s prayer and made it possible for rachel to have children.
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
she said, “god has taken away my shame.” 
rachel named the son joseph, saying, “may the lord give me another son.” 
after the birth of joseph, jacob said to laban, “now let me go back to my own homeland.
give me my wives and my children.
i have earned them by working for you.
you know that i served you well.” 
laban said to him, “please, let me say something.
i know that the lord has blessed me because of you.
tell me what i should pay you, and i will give it to you.” 
jacob answered, “you know that i have worked hard for you.
your flocks have grown and been well while i cared for them.
when i came, you had little.
now you have much, much more.
every time i did something for you, the lord blessed you.
now it is time for me to work for myself—it is time to do things for my family.” 
laban asked, “then what should i give you?” jacob answered, “i don’t want you to give me anything!
i only want you to let me do this one thing: i will go back and take care of your sheep.
but let me go through all your flocks today and take every lamb with spots or stripes.
let me take every black young goat and every female goat with stripes or spots.
that will be my pay.
in the future you can easily see if i am honest.
you can come to look at my flocks.
if i have any goat that isn’t spotted or any sheep that isn’t black, you will know that i stole it.” 
laban answered, “i agree to that.
we will do what you ask.” 
but that day laban hid all the male goats that had spots.
and he hid all the female goats that had spots on them.
he also hid all the black sheep.
laban told his sons to watch these sheep.
so the sons took all the spotted animals and led them to another place.
they traveled for three days.
jacob stayed and took care of all the animals that were left.
then jacob cut green branches from poplar and almond trees.
he stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them.
he put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places.
when the animals came to drink, they also mated in that place.
then when the goats mated in front of the branches, the young that were born were spotted, striped, or black.
jacob separated the spotted and the black animals from the other animals in the flock.
he kept his animals separate from laban’s.
any time the stronger animals in the flock were mating, jacob put the branches before their eyes.
the animals mated near those branches.
but when the weaker animals mated, jacob did not put the branches there.
so the young animals born from the weak animals were laban’s.
and the young animals born from the stronger animals were jacob’s.
in this way jacob became very rich.
he had large flocks, many servants, camels, and donkeys.
chapter 3.
“yes, at that time i will bring back the people of judah and jerusalem from captivity.
i will also gather all the nations together.
i will bring all these nations down into jehoshaphat valley.
there i will judge them.
those nations scattered my people, israel.
they forced them to live in other nations, so i will punish those nations.
they divided up my land.
they threw lots for my people.
they sold boys to buy a prostitute, and they sold girls to buy wine to drink.
all of you areas of philistia!
you are not important to me!
are you punishing me for something i did?
you might think that you are punishing me, but i will soon punish you.
you took my silver and gold.
you took my precious treasures and put them in your temples.
“you sold the people of judah and jerusalem to the greeks.
that way you could take them far from their land.
you sent my people to that faraway place, but i will bring them back.
and i will punish you for what you did.
i will sell your sons and daughters to the people of judah.
then they will sell them to the faraway sabeans.” this is what the lord said.
announce this among the nations: prepare for war!
wake up the strong men!
let all the men of war come near.
let them come up!
beat your plows into swords.
make spears from your pruning hooks.
let the weak man say, “i am a strong soldier.” 
all you nations, hurry!
come together in that place.
lord, bring your strong soldiers.
wake up, nations!
come to jehoshaphat valley.
there i will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
bring the sickle, because the harvest is ripe.
come, walk on the grapes, because the winepress is full.
the barrels will be full and spilling over, because their evil is great.
there are many, many people in the valley of decision.
the lord’s special day is near in the valley of decision.
the sun and the moon will become dark.
the stars will stop shining.
the lord god will shout from zion.
he will shout from jerusalem, and the sky and the earth will shake.
but the lord god will be a safe place for his people.
he will be a place of safety for the people of israel.
“then you will know that i am the lord your god.
i live on zion, my holy mountain.
jerusalem will become holy.
strangers will never pass through that city again.
“on that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine.
the hills will flow with milk, and water will flow through all the empty rivers of judah.
a fountain will come from the lord’s temple.
it will give water to acacia valley.
egypt will be empty.
edom will be an empty wilderness, because they were cruel to the people of judah.
they killed innocent people in their country.
but there will always be people living in judah.
people will live in jerusalem through many generations.
those people killed my people, so i really will punish them!” the lord god will live in zion!
chapter 13.
but at that time a new spring of water will be opened for david’s family and for the other people living in jerusalem.
that fountain will be to wash away their sins and to make the people pure.
the lord all-powerful says, “at that time i will remove all the idols from the earth.
people will not even remember their names, and i will remove the false prophets and unclean spirits from the earth.
whoever continues to prophesy will be punished.
even their parents, their own mother and father, will say to them, ‘you have spoken lies in the name of the lord, so you must die!’ their own mother and father will stab them for prophesying.
at that time the prophets will be ashamed of their visions and prophecies.
they will not wear the rough cloth that shows a person is a prophet.
they will not wear those clothes to trick people with the lies they call prophecies.
they will say, ‘i am not a prophet.
i am a farmer.
i have worked as a farmer since i was a little child.’ 
but other people will say, ‘then what are these wounds in your hands?’ he will say, ‘i was beaten in the house of my friends.’” 
the lord all-powerful says, “sword, wake up and strike the shepherd, my friend!
strike the shepherd, and the sheep will run away.
and i will punish those little ones.
two-thirds of the people in the land will be struck down and die,” says the lord, “but one-third will survive.
then i will test those survivors by giving them many troubles.
the troubles will be like the fire a person uses to prove silver is pure.
i will test them the way a person tests gold.
then they will call to me for help, and i will answer them.
i will say, ‘you are my people.’ and they will say, ‘the lord is my god.’” 
psalm.
chapter 113.
praise the lord!
servants of the lord, praise him!
praise the lord’s name.
may the lord’s name be praised now and forever.
may the lord’s name be praised from where the sun rises to where it goes down.
the lord is higher than all nations.
his glory rises to the skies.
there is no one like the lord our god.
he sits on his throne high in heaven.
he is so high above us that he must look down to see the sky and the earth.
he lifts the poor out of the dirt and rescues beggars from the garbage dump.
he puts them in important positions, giving them a place among the leaders of his people.
he gives children to the woman whose home is empty.
he makes her a happy mother.
praise the lord!
chapter 110.
a praise song of david.
the lord said to my lord, “sit at my right side, while i put your enemies under your control.” 
the lord will cause your kingdom to grow, beginning at zion, until you rule the lands of your enemies!
your people will gladly join you when you gather your army together.
you will wear your special clothes and meet together early in the morning.
your young men will be all around you like dew on the ground.
the lord has made a promise with an oath and will not change his mind: “you are a priest forever— the kind of priest melchizedek was.” 
my lord is at your right side.
he will defeat the other kings when he becomes angry.
he will judge the nations.
the ground will be covered with dead bodies.
he will punish the leaders of powerful nations all around the world.
the king will drink from a stream on the way.
then he will lift his head and become strong!
chapter 52.
zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king of judah.
he ruled in jerusalem for eleven years.
his mother’s name was hamutal daughter of jeremiah.
hamutal’s family was from the town of libnah.
zedekiah did evil things, just as king jehoiakim had done.
the lord did not like zedekiah doing those evil things.
terrible things happened to the people of jerusalem and judah because the lord was angry with them.
finally, he threw them out of his presence.
zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon.
so in the ninth year of zedekiah’s rule, on the tenth day of the tenth month, king nebuchadnezzar of babylon marched against jerusalem with his whole army.
the army of babylon set up their camp outside of jerusalem.
then they built ramps all around the city walls so that they could get over the walls.
the city of jerusalem was surrounded by the army of babylon until the eleventh year that zedekiah was king.
by the ninth day of the fourth month of that year, the hunger in the city was very bad.
there was no food left for the people in the city to eat.
on that day the army of babylon broke into jerusalem.
the soldiers of jerusalem ran away.
they left the city at night.
they went through the gate between the two walls.
that gate was near the king’s garden.
even though the army of babylon had surrounded the city, the soldiers of jerusalem still ran away toward the desert.
but the babylonian army chased king zedekiah and caught him on the plains of jericho.
all of zedekiah’s soldiers ran away.
the army of babylon captured king zedekiah and took him to the king of babylon who was at the city of riblah, in the land of hamath.
at riblah the king of babylon announced his judgment on king zedekiah.
there at the town of riblah, the king of babylon killed zedekiah’s sons while zedekiah watched.
the king of babylon also killed all the royal officials of judah.
then the king of babylon tore out zedekiah’s eyes.
he put bronze chains on him and took him to babylon.
in babylon he put zedekiah into prison.
he stayed in prison until the day he died.
nebuzaradan was the commander of the king of babylon’s special guard.
he was one of the king’s most important officials while at jerusalem.
he came to jerusalem on the tenth day of the fifth month, in the 19th year that nebuchadnezzar was king.
nebuzaradan burned the lord’s temple, the king’s palace, and every important building in jerusalem, as well as all the houses.
all the babylonian soldiers that were with the commander broke down the walls around jerusalem.
commander nebuzaradan took the people who were still in jerusalem and those who had surrendered earlier and made them captives.
he took them and the skilled craftsmen who were left in jerusalem as captives to babylon.
but nebuzaradan left some of the poorest people behind in the land.
he left them to work in the vineyards and the fields.
the babylonian army broke up the bronze columns of the lord’s temple.
they also broke up the stands and the bronze tank that were in the lord’s temple.
they carried all that bronze to babylon.
the army of babylon also took these things from the temple: pots, shovels, lamp snuffers, large bowls, pans, and all the bronze things that were used in the temple service.
the commander of the king’s special guards took these things away: basins, firepans, large bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and bowls used for drink offerings.
he took everything that was made of gold or silver.
the two pillars, the sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the moveable stands were very heavy.
king solomon had made those things for the lord’s temple.
the bronze that those things were made of was so heavy it could not be weighed.
each of the bronze pillars was 31 feet tall.
each pillar was almost 21 feet around.
each pillar was hollow.
the wall of each pillar was 3 inches thick.
the bronze capital on top of the first pillar was over 5 feet tall.
it was decorated with a net design and bronze pomegranates all around it.
the other pillar had pomegranates too.
it was like the first pillar.
there were 96 pomegranates on the sides of the pillars.
all together, there were 100 pomegranates above the net design that went around the pillars.
the commander of the king’s special guards took seraiah the high priest and zephaniah the next highest priest as prisoners.
the three doorkeepers were also taken as prisoners.
the commander of the king’s special guards also took the officer in charge of the fighting men.
he also took seven of the king’s advisors as prisoners.
they were still there in jerusalem.
he also took the scribe who was in charge of putting people in the army.
and he took 60 of the ordinary people who were there in the city.
nebuzaradan, the commander, took all these officials and brought them to the king of babylon.
the king of babylon was at the city of riblah.
riblah is in the country of hamath.
there at the city of riblah, the king ordered all of them to be killed.
so the people of judah were taken from their country.
this is how many people nebuchadnezzar carried into captivity: in nebuchadnezzar’s 7th year as king of babylon, 3023 people were taken from judah.
in nebuchadnezzar’s 18th year as king of babylon, 832 people were taken from jerusalem.
in nebuchadnezzar’s 23rd year as king, nebuzaradan took 745 people of judah into captivity.
nebuzaradan was the commander of the king’s special guards.
in all, 4600 people were taken captive.
king jehoiachin of judah was in prison in babylon for 37 years.
in the 37th year of his imprisonment, king evil merodach of babylon was very kind to jehoiachin.
he let jehoiachin out of prison in that year.
this was the same year that evil merodach became king of babylon.
he set jehoiachin free from prison on the 25th day of the 12th month.
evil merodach spoke kindly to jehoiachin.
he gave jehoiachin a place of honor higher than the other kings who were with him in babylon.
so jehoiachin took his prison clothes off.
for the rest of his life, he ate regularly at the king’s table.
every day the king of babylon paid jehoiachin enough to take care of his needs until the day jehoiachin died.
song of songs.
chapter 3.
at night on my bed, i look for the man i love.
i looked for him, but i could not find him.
i will get up now!
i will go around the city.
in the streets and squares, i will look for the man i love.
i looked for him, but i could not find him.
the guards patrolling the city found me.
i asked them, “have you seen the man i love?” 
i had just left the guards when i found the man i love!
i held him and would not let him go, while i took him to my mother’s house, to the room of one who bore me.
women of jerusalem, promise me by the gazelles and wild deer, don’t awaken love, don’t arouse love, until i am ready.
who is this woman coming from the desert with this large group of people?
the dust rises behind them like clouds of smoke from burning myrrh and frankincense and other spices.
look, solomon’s traveling chair.
there are 60 soldiers guarding it, strong soldiers of israel.
all of them are trained fighting men with their swords at their side, ready for any danger of the night.
king solomon made a traveling chair for himself.
the wood came from lebanon.
the poles were made from silver, and the supports were made from gold.
the seat was covered with purple cloth.
it was inlaid with love by the women of jerusalem.
women of zion, come out and see king solomon.
see the crown his mother put on him the day he was married, the day he was so happy!
chapter 6.
then the word of the lord came to me again.
he said, “son of man, turn toward the mountains of israel and speak against them for me.
tell them this: ‘mountains of israel, listen to this message from the lord god!
this is what the lord god says to the hills and mountains and to the ravines and valleys: look!
i am bringing the enemy to fight against you.
i will destroy your high places.
your altars will be broken into pieces.
your incense altars will be smashed, and i will throw down your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols.
i will put the dead bodies of the people of israel in front of their filthy idols.
i will scatter your bones around your altars.
bad things will happen wherever your people live.
their cities will become piles of rock.
their high places will be destroyed so that those places of worship will never be used again.
the altars will all be destroyed.
people will never worship those filthy idols again.
the incense altars will be smashed.
everything you made will be destroyed completely.
your people will be killed, and then you will know that i am the lord!’” 
god said, “but i will let a few of your people escape.
they will live in other countries for a short time.
i will scatter them and force them to live in other countries.
then the survivors will be taken as prisoners.
they will be forced to live in other countries, but they will remember me.
i broke their spirit.
they will hate themselves for the evil things they did.
in the past, they turned away from me and left me.
they chased after their filthy idols.
they were like a woman leaving her husband and running off with another man.
they did many terrible things, 
but they will learn that i am the lord.
then they will know that if i say that i will do something, i will do it!
they will know that i caused all the troubles that happened to them.” 
then the lord god said to me, “clap your hands and stamp your feet.
speak against all the terrible things that the people of israel have done.
warn them that they will be killed by disease and hunger.
tell them they will be killed in war.
people far away will die from disease.
people near this place will be killed with swords, and those who are left in the city will starve to death.
only then will i stop being angry.
only then will you know that i am the lord.
you will know this when you see your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols and around their altars.
those bodies will be near every one of your places for worship, on every high hill and mountain, under every green tree and every oak tree with leaves.
you offered your sacrifices everywhere.
they were a sweet smell for your filthy idols.
but i will raise my arm over you and punish you and your people, wherever they live!
i will destroy your country!
it will be completely empty from the desert in the south to riblah in the north.
then they will know that i am the lord!”

chapter 48.
“the northern border goes east from the mediterranean sea to hethlon to hamath pass and then all the way to hazar enan.
this is on the border between damascus and hamath.
the land for the tribes in this group will go from the east of these borders to the west.
from north to south, the tribes in this area are dan, asher, naphtali, manasseh, ephraim, reuben, and judah.
“the next area of land will be for a special use.
this land is south of judah’s land.
this area is 25,000 cubits long from north to south.
from east to west, it will be as wide as the land that belongs to the other tribes.
the temple will be in the middle of this section of land.
you will dedicate this land to the lord.
it will be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide.
this special area of land will be divided among the priests and levites.
“the priests will get one part of this area.
the land will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side, 10,000 cubits wide on the west side, 10,000 cubits wide on the east side, and 25,000 cubits long on the south side.
the lord’s temple will be in the middle of this area of land.
this land is for zadok’s descendants.
these men were chosen to be my holy priests, because they continued to serve me when the other people of israel left me.
zadok’s family did not leave me like the other people from the tribe of levi.
this share from this holy part of the land will be especially for these priests.
it will be next to the land of the levites.
“next to the land for the priests, the levites will have a share of the land.
it will be 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide.
they will get the full length and width of this land—25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide.
the levites will not sell or trade any of this land.
they will not be able to sell any of it.
they must not cut up this part of the country, because this land belongs to the lord—it is very special.
it is the best part of the land.
“there will be an area of land 5000 cubits wide by 25,000 cubits long that is left over from the land given to the priests and levites.
this land can be for the city, for grasslands for animals, and for building houses.
the common people may use this land.
the city will be in the middle of it.
these are the city’s measurements: the north side will be 4500 cubits.
the south side will be 4500 cubits.
the east side will be 4500 cubits.
the west side will be 4500 cubits.
the city will have grasslands.
these grasslands will be 250 cubits on the north and 250 cubits on the south.
they will be 250 cubits on the east and 250 cubits on the west.
what is left of the length along the side of the holy area will be 10,000 cubits on the east and 10,000 cubits on the west.
this land will be along the side of the holy area.
this land will grow food for the city workers.
the city workers from all the tribes of israel will farm this land.
“this special area of land will be square.
it will be 25,000 cubits long by 25,000 cubits wide.
you must set apart this area for its special purposes.
one part is for the priests, one part is for the levites, and one part is for the city.
“part of that special land will be for the ruler of the country.
that special area of land is square.
it is 25,000 cubits long by 25,000 cubits wide.
part of this special land is for the priests, part of it is for the levites, and part of it is for the temple.
the temple is in the middle of this area of land.
the rest of the land belongs to the ruler of the country.
the ruler will get the area between the land of benjamin and the land of judah.
“south of this special area will be the land for the tribes that lived east of the jordan river.
each tribe will get a section of land that goes from the eastern border to the mediterranean sea.
from north to south, these tribes are benjamin, simeon, issachar, zebulun, and gad.
“the southern border of gad’s land will go from tamar to the oasis at meribah-kadesh, then along the brook of egypt to the mediterranean sea.
this is the land that you will divide among the tribes of israel.
this is what each group will get.” this is what the lord god said!
“these are the gates of the city.
the gates will be named for the tribes of israel.
“the north side of the city will be 4500 cubits long.
there will be three gates: reuben’s gate, judah’s gate, and levi’s gate.
“the east side of the city will be 4500 cubits long.
there will be three gates: joseph’s gate, benjamin’s gate, and dan’s gate.
“the south side of the city will be 4500 cubits long.
there will be three gates: simeon’s gate, issachar’s gate, and zebulun’s gate.
“the west side of the city will be 4500 cubits long.
there will be three gates: gad’s gate, asher’s gate, and naphtali’s gate.
“the distance around the city will be 18,000 cubits.
from now on, the name of the city will be the lord is there.” 
psalm.
chapter 24.
a song of david.
the earth and everything on it belong to the lord.
the world and all its people belong to him.
he built the earth on the water.
he built it over the rivers.
who can go up on the lord’s mountain?
who can stand in his holy temple?
only those who have not done evil, who have pure hearts, who have not used my name to hide their lies, and who have not made false promises.
good people ask the lord to bless others.
they ask god, their savior, to do good things.
they try to follow god.
they go to the god of jacob for help.
selah 
gates, proudly lift your heads!
open, ancient doors, and the glorious king will come in.
who is the glorious king?
he is the lord, the powerful soldier.
he is the lord, the war hero.
gates, proudly lift your heads!
open, ancient doors, and the glorious king will come in.
who is the glorious king?
the lord all-powerful is the glorious king.
chapter 29.
a song of david.
praise the lord, you heavenly angels!
praise the lord’s glory and power.
praise the lord and honor his name!
worship the lord in all his holy beauty.
the lord’s voice can be heard over the sea.
the voice of our glorious lord god is like thunder over the great ocean.
the lord’s voice is powerful.
it shows the lord’s glory.
the lord’s voice shatters great cedar trees.
the lord breaks the great cedars of lebanon.
he makes lebanon shake like a young calf dancing.
sirion trembles like a young bull jumping up and down.
the lord’s voice cuts the air with flashes of lightning.
the lord’s voice shakes the desert.
the desert of kadesh trembles at the lord’s voice.
the lord’s voice frightens the deer.
he destroys the forests.
in his temple everyone shouts, “glory to god!” 
the lord ruled as king at the time of the flood, and the lord will rule as king forever.
may the lord make his people strong.
may the lord bless his people with peace.
chapter 2.
these are the people of the province who returned from captivity.
king nebuchadnezzar of babylon had taken these people as prisoners to babylon.
they now returned to jerusalem and judah, everyone to their own town.
these are the people who returned with zerubbabel: jeshua, nehemiah, seraiah, reelaiah, mordecai, bilshan, mispar, bigvai, rehum, and baanah.

the descendants of arah 775 
the descendants of pahath moab of the family of jeshua and joab 2812

from the town of harim 320 
from the towns of lod, hadid, and ono 725 
from the town of jericho 345 
from the town of senaah 3630 
these are the priests: the descendants of jedaiah through the family of jeshua 973 
the descendants of immer 1052 
the descendants of pashhur 1247 
the descendants of harim 1017 
these are the people from the tribe of levi: the descendants of jeshua and kadmiel through the family of hodaviah 74 
these are the singers: the descendants of asaph 128 
these are the descendants of the temple gatekeepers: the descendants of shallum, ater, talmon, akkub, hatita, and shobai 139 
these are the descendants of the special temple servants: ziha, hasupha, tabbaoth, 
keros, siaha, padon, 
lebanah, hagabah, akkub,

these are the descendants of solomon’s servants: sotai, hassophereth, peruda, 
jaala, darkon, giddel, 
shephatiah, hattil, pokereth hazzebaim, and ami, 
the temple servants and descendants of solomon’s servants 392 
some people came to jerusalem from the towns of tel melah, tel harsha, kerub, addon, and immer.
but these people could not prove that their families were from the family of israel: 
the descendants of delaiah, tobiah, and nekoda 652 
from the family of priests there were descendants of hobaiah, hakkoz, and barzillai (if a man married a daughter of barzillai from gilead, he was counted as a descendant of barzillai.)
these people searched for their family histories, but they could not find them.
their names were not included in the list of priests.
they could not prove that their ancestors were priests, so they could not serve as priests.
the governor ordered them not to eat any of the holy food until there was a priest who could use the urim and thummim to ask god what to do.
all together, there were 42,360 people in the group who came back.
this is not counting their 7337 men and women slaves.
they also had 200 men and women singers with them.
they had 736 horses, 245 mules, 435 camels, and 6720 donkeys.
when the group arrived at the place in jerusalem where the lord’s temple had been, the family leaders gave their gifts for building this house of god again.
they wanted to build it in this same place.
they gave as much as they were able.
these are the things they gave for building the temple: 1100 pounds of gold, about 4 tons of silver, and 100 coats that priests wear.
so the priests, levites, and some of the other people moved to jerusalem and the area around it.
this group included the temple singers, gatekeepers, and the temple servants.
the other israelites settled in their own hometowns.
chapter 25.
the lord spoke to moses at mount sinai.
he said, 
“tell the israelites: when you enter the land that i am giving to you, you must let the land have a special time of rest.
this will be a special time of rest to honor the lord.
you will plant seed in your field for six years.
you will trim your vineyards for six years and bring in its fruits.
but during the seventh year, you will let the land rest.
this will be a special time of rest to honor the lord.
you must not plant seed in your field or trim your vineyards.
you must not cut the crops that grow by themselves after your harvest.
you must not gather the grapes from your vines that are not trimmed.
the land will have a year of rest.
“the land will have a year of rest, but you will still have enough food.
there will be enough food for your men and women servants.
there will be food for your hired workers and for the foreigners living in your country.
and there will be enough food for your cattle and other animals to eat.
“you will also count seven groups of seven years.
this will be 49 years.
during that time there will be seven years of rest for the land.
on the day of atonement, you must blow a ram’s horn.
that will be on the tenth day of the seventh month.
you must blow the ram’s horn through the whole country.
you will make the 50th year a special year.
you will announce freedom for everyone living in your country.
this time will be called ‘jubilee.’ each of you will go back to your own property.
and each of you will go back to your own family.
the 50th year will be a special celebration for you.
don’t plant seeds, don’t harvest the crops that grow by themselves, and don’t gather grapes from the vines that are not trimmed.
that year is jubilee.
it will be a holy time for you.
you will eat the crops that come from the field.
in the year of jubilee, you will go back to your own property.
“don’t cheat your neighbors when you sell your land to them.
don’t cheat one another when you buy or sell land.
if you want to buy your neighbor’s land, count the number of years since the last jubilee, and use that number to decide the right price.
you are only buying the rights for harvesting crops until the next jubilee.
if there are many years before the next jubilee, the price will be high.
if the years are few, the price will be lower.
so your neighbor is really only selling a number of crops to you.
at the next jubilee, the land will again belong to that family.
you must not cheat each other.
you must honor your god.
i am the lord your god.
“remember my laws and rules.
obey them and you will live safely in your country.
and the land will produce good crops for you.
then you will have plenty of food, and you will live safely on the land.
“but maybe you will say, ‘if we don’t plant seeds or gather our crops, we will not have anything to eat during the seventh year.’ 
i will order my blessing to come to you during the sixth year.
the land will continue growing crops for three years.
when you plant in the eighth year, you will still be eating from the old crop.
you will eat the old crop until the ninth year, when the crop you planted in the eighth year comes in.
“the land really belongs to me, so you cannot sell it permanently.
you are only foreigners and travelers living on my land with me.
people might sell their land, but the family will always get their land back.
if someone in your country becomes very poor and must sell their property, a close relative must come and buy it back.
if there is not a close relative to buy back the land, the person might get enough money to buy it back.
then the years must be counted since the land was sold.
that number must be used to decide how much to pay for the land.
the person must then buy back the land, and it will be their property again.
but if this first owner cannot find enough money to buy the land back, it will stay in the hands of the one who bought it until the year of jubilee.
then during that special celebration, the land will go back to the first owner’s family.
so the property will again belong to the right family.
“anyone who sells a home in a walled city still has the right to get it back until a full year after it was sold.
their right to get the house back will continue one year.
but if the owner does not buy back the house before a full year is finished, the house that is in the walled city will belong to the one who bought it and to their descendants.
the house will not go back to the first owner at the time of jubilee.
towns without walls around them will be treated like open fields.
so houses built in these small towns will go back to the first owners at the time of jubilee.
“but about the cities of the levites: the levites can buy back at any time their houses in the cities that belong to them.
if someone buys a house from a levite, that house in the levites’ city will again belong to the levites at the time of jubilee.
this is because houses in levite cities belong to those from the tribe of levi.
the israelites gave these cities to the levites.
also, the fields and pastures around the levite cities cannot be sold.
they belong to the levites forever.
“if anyone from your own country becomes too poor to support themselves, you must let them live with you like a visitor.
don’t charge them any interest on money you might loan to them.
respect your god and let those from your own country live with you.
don’t charge them interest on any money you lend them.
and don’t try to make a profit from the food you sell them.
i am the lord your god.
i brought you out of the land of egypt to give the land of canaan to you and to become your god.
“if anyone from your own country becomes so poor that they must sell themselves to you, don’t make them work like slaves.
they will be like hired workers and visitors with you until the year of jubilee.
then they can leave you, take their children, and go back to their family.
they can go back to the property of their ancestors, 
because they are my servants.
i brought them out of slavery in egypt.
they must not become slaves again.
you must not be a cruel master to them.
you must respect your god.
“about your men and women slaves: you may get men and women slaves from the other nations around you.
also, you may get children as slaves if they come from the families of the foreigners living in your land.
these child slaves will belong to you.
you may even pass these foreign slaves on to your children after you die so that they will belong to them.
they will be your slaves forever.
you may make slaves of these foreigners.
but you must not be a cruel master over your own brothers, the israelites.
“maybe a foreigner or visitor among you becomes rich.
or maybe someone from your own country becomes so poor that they sell themselves as slaves to a foreigner living among you or to a member of a foreigner’s family.
these people have the right to be bought back and become free.
someone from their own country can buy them back.
or their uncle, their cousin, or one of their close relatives from their family can buy him back.
or if they get enough money, they can pay the money themselves and become free again.
“you must count the years from the time they sold themselves to the foreigner up to the next year of jubilee.
use that number to decide the price, because really the person only ‘hired’ them for a few years.
if there are still many years before the year of jubilee, the one sold must give back a large part of the price.
it all depends on the number of years.
if only a few years are left until the year of jubilee, the one who was sold must pay a small part of the original price.
but that person will live like a hired worker with the foreigner every year.
don’t let the foreigner be a cruel master over that person.
“those who sold themselves will become free, even if no one buys them back.
at the year of jubilee, they and their children will become free.
this is because the israelites are my servants.
they are the servants who i brought out of slavery in egypt.
i am the lord your god!
chapter 42.
while they were at geruth kimham, johanan son of kareah and jezaniah son of hoshaiah went to jeremiah the prophet.
all the army officers went with johanan and jezaniah.
all the people, from the least important to the most important, went to jeremiah.
they said to him, “jeremiah, please listen to what we ask.
pray to the lord your god for all those who are survivors from the family of judah.
jeremiah, you can see that there are not many of us left.
at one time there were many of us.
jeremiah, pray that the lord your god will tell us where we should go and what we should do.” 
then jeremiah the prophet answered, “i understand what you want me to do.
i will pray to the lord your god, as you asked me to do.
i will tell you everything the lord says.
i will not hide anything from you.” 
then the people said to jeremiah, “if we don’t do everything the lord your god tells us, then we hope the lord will be a true and faithful witness against us.
we know he will send you to tell us what to do.
it doesn’t matter if we like the message or if we don’t like the message.
we will obey the lord our god.
we are sending you to the lord for a message from him.
we will obey what he says.
then good things will happen to us.
yes, we will obey the lord our god.” 
at the end of ten days, the message from the lord came to jeremiah.
then jeremiah called together johanan son of kareah and the army officers who were with him.
he also called all the other people together, from the least important to the most important.
then jeremiah said to them, “you sent me to the lord, the god of israel, and i asked him what you wanted me to ask.
this is what he says: 
‘if you will stay in judah, i will make you strong—i will not destroy you.
i will plant you, and i will not pull you up.
i will do this because i am sad about the terrible things that i made happen to you.
now you are afraid of the king of babylon.
but don’t be afraid of him.
don’t be afraid of the king of babylon,’ says the lord, ‘because i am with you.
i will save you.
i will rescue you.
he will not get his hands on you.
i will be kind to you, and the king of babylon will also treat you with mercy.
he will bring you back to your land.’ 
but you might say, ‘we will not stay in judah.’ if you say that, you will disobey the lord your god.
and you might say, ‘no, we will go and live in egypt.
we will not be bothered with war there.
we will not hear the trumpets of war, and in egypt we will not be hungry.’ 
if you say that, listen to this message from the lord, you survivors from judah.
this is what the lord all-powerful, the god of the people of israel, says: ‘if you decide to go and live in egypt, this will happen: 
you are afraid of the sword of war, but it will defeat you there.
and you are worried about hunger, but you will be hungry in egypt.
you will die there.
everyone who decides to go live in egypt will die by war, hunger, or disease.
not one person who goes to egypt will survive.
not one of them will escape the terrible things that i will bring to them.’ 
“this is what the lord all-powerful, the god of the people of israel, says: ‘i showed my anger against jerusalem.
i punished the people who lived there.
in the same way i will show my anger against everyone who goes to egypt.
people will use you as an example when they ask for bad things to happen to other people.
you will become like a curse word.
people will be ashamed of you, and they will insult you.
and you will never see judah again.’ 
“survivors of judah, the lord told you: ‘don’t go to egypt.’ i warn you right now, 
you are making a mistake that will cause your deaths.
you sent me to the lord your god.
you said to me, ‘pray to the lord our god for us.
tell us everything the lord our god says to do.
we will obey him.’ 
so today i have told you the message from the lord.
but you have not obeyed the lord your god.
you have not done all that he sent me to tell you to do.
so now be sure you understand this: you want to go live in egypt.
but these things will happen to you in egypt: you will die by a sword, or hunger, or terrible sickness.” 
psalm.
chapter 21.
to the director: a song of david.
lord, your strength makes the king happy.
he is so happy when you give him victory.
and you gave him what he wanted.
you gave him what he asked for.
selah 
you gave the king such wonderful blessings.
you put a golden crown on his head.
he asked for life, and you gave it.
you gave him life that goes on forever.
you led him to victory that brought him great glory.
you gave him honor and fame.
you have given him blessings that will last forever.
you have given him the joy of being near you.
the king trusts in the lord, and the faithful love of god most high will keep him from falling.
lord, you will show all your enemies that you are strong.
your power will defeat those who hate you.
when you appear, you will burn them up like a blazing furnace.
in your anger, lord, you will completely destroy them; they will be swallowed by flames of fire.
their families will be destroyed.
they will be removed from the earth.
that is because they made evil plans against you.
they wanted to do things they could not do.
you will make them turn and run away when you aim your arrows at their faces.
lord, we lift you up with our songs of praise.
we sing and play songs about your power!
chapter 16.
then all the israelites left elim.
they reached the western sinai desert, between elim and mount sinai, on the 15th day of the second month after leaving egypt.
then the whole community of israelites began complaining again.
they complained to moses and aaron in the desert.
they said, “it would have been better if the lord had just killed us in the land of egypt.
at least there we had plenty to eat.
we had all the food we needed.
but now you have brought us out here into this desert to make us all die from hunger.” 
then the lord said to moses, “i will cause food to fall from the sky.
this food will be for you to eat.
every day the people should go out and gather the food they need that day.
i will do this to see if they will do what i tell them.
every day the people will gather only enough food for one day.
but on friday, when the people prepare their food, they will see that they have enough food for two days.” 
so moses and aaron said to the israelites, “tonight you will see the power of the lord.
you will know that he is the one who brought you out of egypt.
you have been complaining about the lord, and he heard you.
so tomorrow morning you will see the glory of the lord.
you have been complaining and complaining about us.
maybe now we can have a little rest.” 
then moses said, “in the evening the lord will give you meat to eat, and in the morning you will have all the bread you want.
the lord will do this because he has heard your complaining, which was against him, not us.
what can we do?
we do only what he tells us to do, so your complaints are really against the lord.” 
then moses said to aaron, “tell the whole community of israelites to come together before the lord, because he has heard their complaints.” 
so aaron spoke to all the israelites.
while he was talking, the people turned and looked into the desert.
and they saw the glory of the lord appear in a cloud.
the lord said to moses, 
“i have heard the complaints of the israelites.
so tell them, ‘tonight you will eat meat.
and in the morning you will have all the bread you want.
then you will know you can trust the lord, your god.’” 
that evening, flocks of quail came and filled the camp, and in the morning dew lay on the ground all around it.
after the dew was gone, something like thin flakes of frost was on the ground.
when the israelites saw it, they asked each other, “what is that?” because they did not know what it was.
so moses told them, “this is the food the lord is giving you to eat.
the lord says, ‘each of you should gather what you need, a basket of manna for everyone in your family.’” 
so that is what the israelites did.
some people gathered a large amount, some people gathered a little.
but when they measured what they had gathered, there was no shortage and there was none left over.
everyone gathered just what they needed.
moses told them, “don’t save that food to eat the next day.” 
but some of the people did not obey moses.
they saved their food for the next day.
but worms got into the food and it began to stink.
moses was angry with the people who did this.
every morning the people gathered as much food as they could eat, but by noon the food melted and was gone.
on friday the people gathered twice as much food—two baskets for every person.
so all the leaders of the people came and told this to moses.
moses told them, “this is what the lord said would happen.
it happened because tomorrow is the sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the lord.
you can cook all the food you need to cook for today, but save the rest of this food for tomorrow morning.” 
so the people saved the rest of the food for the next day, as moses had commanded, and none of the food spoiled or had worms in it.
on saturday, moses told the people, “today is the sabbath, the special day of rest to honor the lord.
so none of you should be out in the fields.
eat the food you gathered yesterday.
you should gather the food for six days.
but the seventh day of the week is a day of rest—so there will not be any of the special food on the ground.” 
on saturday, some of the people went out to gather some of the food, but they could not find any.
then the lord said to moses, “how long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings?
look, the lord has made the sabbath a day of rest for you.
so on friday he will give you enough food for two days.
then, on the sabbath, each of you should sit down and relax.
stay where you are.” 
so the people rested on the sabbath.
the people called the special food “manna.” it was like small white coriander seeds and tasted like thin cakes made with honey.
moses told the people what the lord said: “save a basket of this food for your descendants.
then they can see the food that i gave to you in the desert when i took you out of egypt.” 
so moses told aaron, “take a jar and fill it with a full basket of manna.
save this manna to put before the lord.
save it for our descendants.” 
(aaron did what the lord had commanded moses.
aaron put the jar of manna in front of the box of the agreement.)
the people ate the manna for 40 years, until they came to the land of rest, that is, until they came to the edge of the land of canaan.
(the measure they used for the manna was an omer.
an omer was about 8 cups.)
chapter 19.
that evening the two angels came to the city of sodom.
lot was sitting near the city gates and saw them.
he got up and went to them.
he bowed to show respect and said, “sirs, please come to my house, and i will serve you.
there you can wash your feet and stay the night.
then tomorrow you can continue your journey.” the angels answered, “no, we will stay the night in the city square.” 
but lot continued to ask them to come to his house, so they agreed and went with him.
lot gave them something to drink.
he baked some bread for them, and they ate it.
that evening, just before bedtime, men from every part of town came to lot’s house.
they stood around the house and called to lot.
they said, 
“where are the two men who came to you tonight?
bring them out to us.
we want to have sex with them.” 
lot went outside and closed the door behind him.
he said to the men, “no, my friends, i beg you, please don’t do this evil thing!
look, i have two daughters who have never slept with a man before.
i will give my daughters to you.
you can do anything you want with them.
but please don’t do anything to these men.
they have come to my house, and i must protect them.” 
the men surrounding the house answered, “get out of our way!” they said to themselves, “this man lot came to our city as a visitor.
now he wants to tell us how we should live!” then the men said to lot, “we will do worse things to you than to them.” so the men started moving closer and closer to lot.
they were about to break down the door.
but the two men staying with lot opened the door, pulled him back inside the house, and closed the door.
then they did something to the men outside the door—they caused all these evil men, young and old, to become blind.
so the men trying to get in the house could not find the door.
the two men said to lot, “are there any other people from your family living in this city?
do you have any sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any other people from your family here?
if so, you should tell them to leave now.
we are going to destroy this city.
the lord heard how evil this city is, so he sent us to destroy it.” 
so lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, the men who had married his other daughters.
he said, “hurry and leave this city!
the lord will soon destroy it!” but they thought he was joking.
the next morning at dawn, the angels were trying to make lot hurry.
they said, “this city will be punished, so take your wife and your two daughters who are still with you and leave this place.
then you will not be destroyed with the city.” 
when lot did not move fast enough, the two men grabbed his hand.
they also took the hands of his wife and his two daughters.
the two men led lot and his family safely out of the city.
the lord was kind to lot and his family.
so after the two men brought lot and his family out of the city, one of the men said, “now run to save your life!
don’t look back at the city, and don’t stop anywhere in the valley.
run until you are in the mountains.
if you stop, you will be destroyed with the city!” 
but lot said to the two men, “sirs, please don’t force me to run so far!
you have been very kind to me, your servant.
you have been very kind to save me, but i cannot run all the way to the mountains.
what if i am too slow and something happens?
i will be killed!
look, there is a very small town near here.
let me run to that town.
i can run there and be safe.” 
the angel said to lot, “very well, i’ll let you do that.
i will not destroy that town.
but run there quickly.
i cannot destroy sodom until you are safely in that town.” (that town is named zoar, because it is a small town.)
lot was entering the town as the sun came up, 
and the lord began to destroy sodom and gomorrah.
he caused fire and burning sulfur to fall from the sky.
he destroyed the whole valley—all the cities, the people living in the cities, and all the plants in the valley.
lot’s wife was following behind him and looked back at the city.
when she did, she became a block of salt.
early the next morning, abraham got up and went to the place where he stood before the lord.
abraham looked down into the valley toward the cities of sodom and gomorrah.
he saw clouds of smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
god destroyed the cities in the valley, but he remembered what abraham had said.
so god sent lot away from those cities before destroying them.
lot was afraid to stay in zoar, so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave.
one day the older daughter said to the younger, “everywhere on the earth, men and women marry and have a family.
but our father is old, and there are no men around here to give us children.
so let’s get our father drunk with wine.
then we can have sex with him.
that way we can use our father to keep our family alive!” 
that night the two girls went to their father and got him drunk with wine.
then the older daughter went and had sexual relations with him.
he did not even know when she came to bed or when she got up.
the next day the older daughter said to the younger daughter, “last night i went to bed with my father.
let’s get him drunk with wine again tonight.
then you can go and have sex with him.
in this way we can use our father to have children, and our family will not come to an end.” 
so that night the two girls got their father drunk with wine.
then the younger daughter went and had sexual relations with him.
again, lot did not know when she came to bed or when she got up.
both of lot’s daughters became pregnant.
their father was the father of their babies.
the older daughter gave birth to a son.
she named him moab.
moab is the ancestor of all the moabites living today.
the younger daughter also gave birth to a son.
she named him ben-ammi.
ben-ammi is the ancestor of all the ammonites living today.
chapter 9.
then job answered: 
“of course, i know that this is true.
but how can a human being win an argument with god?
anyone who chose to argue with him could not answer one question in a thousand!
god is so wise and powerful that no one could oppose him and survive.
when god is angry, he moves mountains before they know what happened.
he can shake the earth, and it will tremble down to its foundations.
with one command he can stop the sun from rising.
he can lock up the stars and keep them from shining.
he alone made the skies, and he walks on the ocean waves.
“god made the bear, orion, and the pleiades.
he made the planets that cross the southern sky.
he does things too marvelous for people to understand.
he does too many miracles to count!
when he passes by, i cannot see him.
he goes right past me, and i don’t notice.
if he takes something away, no one can stop him.
no one can say to him, ‘what are you doing?’ 
god will not hold back his anger.
even rahab’s helpers are afraid of him.
so i cannot argue with god.
i would not know what to say to him.
i am innocent, but i cannot give him an answer.
all i can do is beg my judge for mercy.
even if i called and he answered, i cannot believe he would listen to me.
he would just send storms to crush me.
he would give me more wounds for no reason.
he would not let me catch my breath again.
he would just give me more trouble.
i cannot defeat god.
he is too powerful!
i cannot take him to court for justice.
who could force him to come?
i am innocent, but anything i say makes me seem guilty.
i am innocent, but if i speak, my mouth proves me wrong.
i am innocent, but i don’t know what to think.
i hate my own life.
so i say, ‘does it make any difference?
god destroys the innocent as well as the guilty.’ 
is it god who laughs when a disaster kills innocent people?
is it god who keeps the leaders from seeing when an evil person takes control?
if it is not god, then who is it?
“my days are passing faster than a runner.
they are flying by without any joy.
they go by as quickly as papyrus boats, as fast as an eagle swooping down on its prey.
“i could say, ‘i will not complain.
i will forget my pain and put a smile on my face.’ 
but the suffering still frightens me.
i know that god will not see me as innocent.
i will be found guilty, so why should i even think about it?
even if i scrubbed my hands with soap and washed myself whiter than snow, 
god would still push me into the slime pit, and even my clothes would hate to touch me.
god is not a human like me, so i cannot argue with him.
i cannot take him to court.
i wish there were someone who could listen to both sides, someone to judge both of us in a fair way.
i wish someone could take away the threat of god’s punishment.
then he would not frighten me anymore.
then i could say what i want without being afraid of him.
but i cannot do that now.
chapter 27.
moses and the elders of israel spoke to the people.
moses said, “obey all the commands that i give you today.
you will soon go across the jordan river into the land that the lord your god is giving you.
on that day you must put up large stones.
cover them with plaster.
then write on the stones all these commands and teachings.
you must do this when you go across the jordan river.
then you may go into the land that the lord your god is giving you—a land filled with many good things.
the lord, the god of your ancestors, promised to give you this land.
“after you go across the jordan river, you must do what i command you today.
you must set up the stones on mount ebal.
you must cover these stones with plaster.
also, use some stones there to build an altar to the lord your god.
don’t use iron tools to cut the stones.
you must not use cut stones to build the altar for the lord your god.
offer burnt offerings on this altar to the lord your god.
and you must sacrifice and eat fellowship offerings there.
eat and enjoy yourselves there together with the lord your god.
you must write all these teachings on the stones that you set up.
write clearly so that they are easy to read.” 
moses and the levite priests spoke to all the israelites.
moses said, “be quiet and listen, israel!
today you have become the people of the lord your god.
so you must do everything that the lord your god tells you.
you must obey his commands and his laws that i am giving you today.” 
that day moses also told the people, 
“after you have gone across the jordan river, these tribes will stand on mount gerizim to read the blessings to the people: simeon, levi, judah, issachar, joseph, and benjamin.
and these tribes will stand on mount ebal to read the curses: reuben, gad, asher, zebulun, dan, and naphtali.
“and the levites will say to all the israelites in a loud voice: 
“‘cursed is the one who makes a false god and puts it in its secret place.
these false gods are only statues that some worker makes from wood, stone or metal.
the lord hates these things!’ “then all the people will answer, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who does not show respect to their father or their mother!’ “then all the people will answer, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who moves a neighbor’s landmark!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who tricks a blind man into going the wrong way!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who does not give fair judgment for the foreigners, orphans, and widows!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who shames his father by having sexual relations with his father’s wife.’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who has sexual relations with any kind of animal!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his sister or half sister!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his mother-in-law!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who kills anyone, even if he is not caught!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who takes money to kill an innocent person!’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
“the levites will say, ‘cursed is the one who does not support this law and agree to obey it.’ “then all the people will say, ‘amen!’ 
joshua.
chapter 15.
the land that was given to judah was divided among the families of that tribe.
that land went to the border of edom and south all the way to the desert of zin at the edge of teman.
the southern border of judah’s land started at the south end of the dead sea.
the border went south to scorpion pass and continued on to zin.
then the border continued south to kadesh barnea.
it continued past hezron to addar.
from addar the border turned and continued to karka.
the border continued to azmon, the brook of egypt, and then to the mediterranean sea.
all that land was on their southern border.
their eastern border was the shore of the dead sea to the area where the jordan river flowed into the sea.
their northern border started at the area where the jordan river flowed into the dead sea.
then the northern border went to beth hoglah and continued north of beth arabah.
the border continued to the stone of bohan.
(bohan was the son of reuben.)
then the northern border went through the valley of achor to debir.
there the border turned to the north and went to gilgal.
gilgal is across from the road that goes through the mountain of adummim.
it is on the south side of the brook.
the border continued along the waters of en shemesh.
the border stopped at en rogel.
then the border went through the valley of ben hinnom beside the southern side of the jebusite city (that is, jerusalem).
there the border went to the top of the hill on the west side of hinnom valley.
this was at the northern end of rephaim valley.
from there the border went to the spring of water of nephtoah.
then the border went to the cities near mount ephron.
there the border turned and went to baalah.
(baalah is also called kiriath jearim.)
at baalah the border turned west and went to the hill country of seir.
the border continued along the north side of mount jearim (kesalon) and continued down to beth shemesh.
from there the border went past timnah.
then the border went to the hill north of ekron.
from there the border turned to shikkeron and went past mount baalah.
the border continued on to jabneel and ended at the mediterranean sea.
the mediterranean sea was the western border.
so the land of judah was inside these four borders.
the families of judah lived in this area.
the lord had commanded joshua to give caleb son of jephunneh part of the land in judah.
so joshua gave caleb the land god had commanded.
joshua gave him the town of kiriath arba, that is, hebron.
(arba was the father of anak.)
caleb forced the three anakite families living in hebron to leave there.
those families were sheshai, ahiman, and talmai.
they were from the family of anak.
then caleb fought against the people living in debir.
(in the past, debir was also called kiriath sepher.)
caleb said, “i will give my daughter in marriage to the man who attacks and conquers kiriath sepher.” 
othniel was the son of caleb’s brother kenaz.
othniel defeated that city, so caleb gave his daughter acsah to othniel to be his wife.
acsah went to live with othniel.
othniel told acsah to ask her father caleb for some more land.
acsah went to her father.
when she got off her donkey, caleb asked her, “what do you want?” 
acsah answered, “give me a blessing.
you gave me dry desert land in the negev.
please give me some land with water on it.” so caleb gave her what she wanted.
he gave her the upper and lower pools of water in that land.
the tribe of judah got the land that god promised them.
each family group got part of the land.
the tribe of judah got all the towns in the southern part of the negev.
these towns were near the border of edom.
here is a list of the towns: kabzeel, eder, jagur, 
kinah, dimonah, adadah, 
kedesh, hazor, ithnan, 
ziph, telem, bealoth, 
hazor hadattah, kerioth hezron (hazor), 
amam, shema, moladah, 
hazar gaddah, heshmon, beth pelet, 
hazar shual, beersheba, biziothiah, 
baalah, iim, ezem, 
eltolad, kesil, hormah, 
ziklag, madmannah, sansannah, 
lebaoth, shilhim, ain, and rimmon.
in all, there were 29 towns and all their fields.
the tribe of judah also got these towns in the western foothills: eshtaol, zorah, ashnah, 
zanoah, en gannim, tappuah, enam, 
jarmuth, adullam, socoh, azekah, 
shaaraim, adithaim, and gederah (gederothaim).
in all, there were 14 towns and all their fields.
the tribe of judah was also given these towns: zenan, hadashah, migdal gad, 
dilean, mizpah, joktheel, 
lachish, bozkath, eglon, 
cabbon, lahmas, kitlish, 
gederoth, beth dagon, naamah, and makkedah.
in all, there were 16 towns and all the fields around them.
the people of judah also got these towns: libnah, ether, ashan, 
iphtah, ashnah, nezib, 
keilah, aczib, and mareshah.
in all, there were nine towns and all the fields around them.
the people of judah also got the town of ekron and all the small towns and fields near it.
they also got the area west of ekron and all the fields and towns near ashdod.
all the area around ashdod and the small towns there were part of the land of judah.
the people of judah also got the area around gaza and the fields and towns that were near it.
their land continued to the river of egypt.
and their land continued along the coast of the mediterranean sea.
the people of judah were also given these towns in the hill country: shamir, jattir, socoh, 
dannah, kiriath sannah (debir), 
anab, eshtemoh, anim, 
goshen, holon, and giloh.
in all, there were eleven towns and all the fields around them.
the people of judah were also given these towns: arab, dumah, eshan, 
janim, beth tappuah, aphekah, 
humtah, kiriath arba (hebron), and zior.
there were nine towns and all the fields around them.
the people of judah were also given these towns: maon, carmel, ziph, juttah, 
jezreel, jokdeam, zanoah, 
kain, gibeah, and timnah.
in all, there were ten towns and all the fields around them.
the people of judah were also given these towns: halhul, beth zur, gedor, 
maarath, beth anoth, and eltekon.
in all, there were six towns and all the fields around them.
the people of judah were also given the two towns of rabbah and kiriath baal (kiriath jearim).
the people of judah were also given these towns in the desert: beth arabah, middin, secacah, 
nibshan, salt city, and en gedi.
in all, there were six towns and all the fields around them.
the army of judah was not able to force out the jebusites living in jerusalem.
so today there are still jebusites living among the people of judah in jerusalem.
chapter 4.
again i saw that many people are treated badly.
i saw their tears, and i saw that there was no one to comfort them.
i saw that cruel people had all the power, and i saw that there was no one to comfort the people they hurt.
i decided that it is better for those who have died than for those who are still alive.
and it is even better for those who die at birth, because they never saw the evil that is done in this world.
then i thought, “why do people work so hard?” i saw people try to succeed and be better than other people.
they do this because they are jealous.
they don’t want other people to have more than they have.
this is senseless.
it is like trying to catch the wind.
some people say, “it is foolish to fold your hands and do nothing.
if you don’t work, you will starve to death.” 
maybe that is true.
but i say it is better to be satisfied with the few things you have than to always be struggling to get more.
again i saw something else that didn’t make sense: 
i saw a man who has no family, not a son or even a brother.
but he continues to work very hard.
he is never satisfied with what he has.
and he works so hard that he never stops and asks himself, “why am i working so hard?
why don’t i let myself enjoy my life?” this is also a very bad and senseless thing.
two people are better than one.
when two people work together, they get more work done.
if one person falls, the other person can reach out to help.
but those who are alone when they fall have no one to help them.
if two people sleep together, they will be warm.
but a person sleeping alone will not be warm.
an enemy might be able to defeat one person, but two people can stand back-to-back to defend each other.
and three people are even stronger.
they are like a rope that has three parts wrapped together—it is very hard to break.
a young leader who is poor but wise is better than a king who is old but foolish.
that old king does not listen to warnings.
maybe the young ruler was born a poor man in the kingdom.
and maybe he came from prison to rule the country.
but i have watched people in this life, and i know this: people will follow that young man.
he will become the new king.
many people will follow this young man.
but later, those same people will not like him.
this is also senseless.
it is like trying to catch the wind.
chapter 61.
to the director: with stringed instruments.
a song of david.
god, hear my cry for help.
listen to my prayer.
from a faraway land i call to you for help.
i feel so weak and helpless!
carry me to a high rock where no one can reach me.
you are my place of safety, a strong tower that protects me from my enemies.
i want to live in your tent forever.
i want to hide where you can protect me.
selah 
god, you heard what i promised to give you, but everything your worshipers have comes from you.
give the king a long life.
let him live forever!
let him rule in your presence forever.
protect him with your faithful love.
then i will praise your name forever.
every day i will do what i promised.
chapter 16.
people might plan what they want to say, but it is the lord who gives them the right words.
people think that whatever they do is right, but the lord judges their reason for doing it.
turn to the lord for help in everything you do, and you will be successful.
the lord has a plan for everything.
in his plan, the wicked will be destroyed.
the lord hates those who are proud.
you can be sure he will punish them all.
faithful love and loyalty will remove your guilt.
respect the lord, and you will stay far away from evil.
when people live to please the lord, even their enemies will be at peace with them.
it is better to be poor and do right than to be rich and do wrong.
people can plan what they want to do, but it is the lord who guides their steps.
when a king speaks, his words are law.
so when he makes a decision, it is never a mistake.
the lord wants all scales and balances to be right; he wants all business agreements to be fair.
kings hate to see anyone doing wrong, because kingdoms grow strong only when everyone is honest and fair.
kings want to hear the truth.
they like those who are honest.
when a king gets angry, he can put someone to death.
so it is wise to keep the king happy.
when the king is happy, life is better for everyone.
when he is pleased, it is like a refreshing spring rain.
wisdom is worth much more than gold.
understanding is worth much more than silver.
good people try to avoid evil.
they watch what they do and protect themselves.
pride is the first step toward destruction.
proud thoughts will lead you to defeat.
it is better to be a humble person living among the poor than to share the wealth among the proud.
good things happen to those who learn from their experiences, and the lord blesses those who trust him.
people will know if someone is wise.
those who choose their words carefully can be very convincing.
good sense is a spring of fresh water to those who have it, but fools can offer only foolishness.
wise people always think before they speak, so what they say is worth listening to.
kind words are like honey; they are easy to accept and good for your health.
there is a way that seems right to people, but that way leads only to death.
the thought of hunger keeps the workers working so that they can eat.
troublemakers create disasters.
their advice destroys like a wildfire.
troublemakers are always causing problems.
their gossip breaks up the closest of friends.
cruel people trick their neighbors and make them do wrong.
with a wink of the eye, they plan to trick someone.
with a grin, they make plans to hurt their friends.
gray hair is a crown of glory on people who have lived good lives.
it is earned by living right.
it is better to be patient than to be a strong soldier.
it is better to control your anger than to capture a city.
people might throw lots to make a decision, but the answer always comes from the lord.
chapter 4.
after all the people had crossed the jordan river, the lord said to joshua, 
“choose twelve men, one from each tribe.
tell them to look in the river where the priests were standing and get twelve rocks from that place.
carry these rocks with you and put them where you stay tonight.” 
so joshua chose one man from each tribe.
then he called the twelve men together.
he said to them, “go out into the river where the holy box of the lord your god is.
each of you must find one rock.
there will be one rock for each of the twelve tribes of israel.
carry that rock on your shoulder.
these rocks will be a sign for you.
in the future, your children will ask you, ‘what do these rocks mean?’ 
you will tell them that the lord stopped the water from flowing in the jordan river.
when the holy box of the lord’s agreement crossed the river, the water stopped flowing.
these rocks will help the israelites remember this forever.” 
so the israelites obeyed joshua.
they carried twelve rocks from the middle of the jordan river.
there was one rock for each of the twelve tribes of israel.
they did this as the lord had commanded joshua.
the men carried the rocks with them.
then they put the rocks at the place where they made their camp.
joshua also put twelve rocks in the middle of the jordan river.
he put them at the place where the priests had stood while carrying the holy box.
these rocks are still there today.
the lord had commanded joshua to tell the people what to do.
this is what moses had said joshua must do.
so the priests carrying the holy box stood in the middle of the river until everything was done.
meanwhile, the people hurried across the river.
after the people finished crossing the river, the priests carried the lord’s holy box to the front of the people.
the men from the tribes of reuben, gad, and half the tribe of manasseh obeyed moses.
these men crossed the river in front of the other people.
these men were prepared for war.
they were going to help the rest of the israelites take the land god had promised to give them.
about 40,000 soldiers, prepared for war, passed before the lord.
they were marching toward the plains of jericho.
that day the lord made joshua a great man to all the israelites.
from that time on, they respected joshua just as they had moses.
then the lord said to joshua, 
“command the priests carrying the box that holds the agreement to come out of the river.” 
so joshua commanded the priests, “come out of the jordan river.” 
the priests obeyed joshua.
they carried the box of the lord’s agreement with them and came out of the river.
when their feet touched the land on the other side of the river, the water in the river began flowing again.
the water again overflowed its banks just as it had before the people crossed.
the people crossed the jordan river on the tenth day of the first month and camped at gilgal, east of jericho.
they carried with them the twelve rocks that they had taken from the jordan river, and joshua set them up at gilgal.
then joshua told the israelites, “in the future your children will ask you, ‘what do these rocks mean?’ 
tell them, ‘these rocks help us remember the way the people of israel crossed the jordan river on dry land.’ 
the lord your god caused the water in the jordan river to stop flowing so that you could cross it on dry land—just as the lord had stopped the water at the red sea so that we could cross it on dry land.
the lord did this so that all the people in this country would know that he is very powerful.
then they will always be afraid of the lord your god.” 
leviticus.
chapter 21.
the lord said to moses, “tell these things to aaron’s sons, the priests: a priest must not make himself unclean by touching a dead person.
but if the dead person was one of his close relatives, he can touch the dead body.
the priest can make himself unclean if the dead person is his mother or father, his son or daughter, his brother or 
his unmarried sister.
(this sister is close to him because she has no husband.
so the priest may make himself unclean for her if she dies.)
but a priest must not make himself unclean if the dead person was only one of his slaves.
“priests must not shave their heads bald.
they must not shave off the edges of their beards.
they must not make any cuts in their bodies.
priests must be holy for their god.
they must show respect for god’s name.
they offer the bread and special gifts to the lord, so they must be holy.
“a priest serves god in a special way, so he must not marry a woman who has had sexual relations with any other man.
he must not marry a prostitute or a divorced woman.
a priest serves god in a special way.
so you must treat him in a special way, because he carries holy things.
he brings the holy bread to me, and i am holy.
i am the lord, and i make you holy.
“if a priest’s daughter becomes a prostitute, she ruins her reputation and brings shame to her father.
she must be burned to death in the fire!
“the high priest was chosen from among his brothers.
the anointing oil was poured on his head.
in this way he was chosen for the special job of being high priest.
he was chosen to wear the special clothes, so he must not do things to show his sadness in public.
he must not let his hair grow wild.
he must not tear his clothes.
he must not make himself unclean by touching a dead body.
he must not go near a dead body, even if it is his own father or mother.
the high priest must not leave god’s holy place, because he might become unclean and then make god’s holy place unclean.
the anointing oil was poured on the high priest’s head.
this separated him from the rest of the people.
i am the lord.
“the high priest must marry a woman who is a virgin.
he must not marry a woman who has had sexual relations with any man.
he must not marry a prostitute, a divorced woman, or a widow.
the high priest must marry a virgin from his own people.
in this way people will show respect for his children.
i, the lord, have separated the high priest for his special work.” 
the lord said to moses, 
“tell aaron: if any of your descendants have anything wrong with them, they must not carry the special bread to god.
any man who has something wrong with him must not serve as priest and bring sacrifices to me.
these men cannot serve as priests: blind men, crippled men, men with bad scars on their faces, men with arms or legs that are too long, 
men with broken feet or hands, 
men with bent backs, men who are dwarfs, men who are cross-eyed, men with rashes or bad skin diseases, and men with crushed testicles.
“if one of aaron’s descendants has something wrong with him, he cannot approach the altar to bring gifts to the lord.
and he cannot carry the special bread to god.
he is from the family of priests, so he can eat the holy bread.
he can also eat the very holy bread.
but he cannot go through the curtain into the most holy place and he cannot go near the altar.
this is because he has something wrong with him.
he must not make my holy places unholy.
i am the lord, and i make these places holy.” 
so moses told these things to aaron, aaron’s sons, and all the israelites.
chapter 11.
king jabin of hazor heard about everything that had happened.
so he decided to call together the armies of several kings.
he sent a message to king jobab of madon to the king of shimron, to the king of acshaph, 
and to the kings of the north in the hill country and in the desert.
jabin sent the message to the kings of the kinnereth, the negev, and the western foothills.
he also sent the message to the king of naphoth dor in the west.
jabin sent the message to the kings of the canaanites in the east and in the west.
he sent the message to the amorites, hittites, perizzites, and jebusites living in the hill country.
he also sent the message to the hivites living below mount hermon near mizpah.
so the armies of all these kings came together.
there were many fighting men and many horses and chariots.
it was a very large army—it looked as if there were as many men as grains of sand on the seashore.
all these kings met together at the small river of merom.
they joined their armies together into one camp and made plans for the battle against israel.
then the lord said to joshua, “don’t be afraid of that army, because i will allow you to defeat them.
by this time tomorrow, you will have killed them all.
you will cut the legs of the horses and burn all their chariots.” 
so joshua and his whole army surprised the enemy and attacked them at the river of merom.
the lord allowed israel to defeat them.
the army of israel defeated them and chased them to greater sidon, misrephoth maim, and the valley of mizpah in the east.
the army of israel fought until none of the enemy was left alive.
joshua did what the lord said to do; he cut the legs of their horses and burned their chariots.
then joshua went back and captured the city of hazor and killed its king.
(hazor was the leader of all the kingdoms that fought against israel.)
the army of israel killed everyone in that city and completely destroyed all the people.
there was nothing left alive.
then they burned the city.
joshua captured all these cities and killed all their kings.
he completely destroyed everything in these cities—just as moses, the lord’s servant, had commanded.
but the army of israel did not burn any cities that were built on hills.
the only city built on a hill that they burned was hazor.
this is the city joshua burned.
the israelites kept for themselves all the things and all the animals they found in the cities.
but they killed all the people there.
they left no one alive.
long ago the lord commanded his servant moses to do this.
then moses commanded joshua to do this.
so joshua obeyed god.
he did everything that the lord had commanded moses.
so joshua defeated all the people in that whole area.
he had control over the hill country, the negev, all the area of goshen, the western foothills, the jordan valley, and the mountains of israel and all the hills near them.
joshua had control of all the land from mount halak near seir to baal gad in the valley of lebanon below mount hermon.
he captured all the kings in that land and killed them.
joshua fought against them for many years.
only one city in all the land made a peace agreement with israel.
that was the hivite city of gibeon.
all the other cities were defeated in war.
the lord made those people feel brave enough to fight against israel.
this was so that israel could destroy them completely without mercy just as the lord had commanded moses to do.
the anakites lived in the hill country in the area of hebron, debir, anab, and judah.
joshua fought them and completely destroyed all the people and their towns.
there were no anakites left living in the land of israel.
the only anakites who were left alive were in gaza, gath, and ashdod.
joshua took control of the whole land of israel as the lord had told moses long ago.
the lord gave that land to israel as he promised.
and joshua divided the land among the tribes of israel.
finally, the fighting ended and there was peace in the land.
chapter 82.
one of asaph’s songs of praise.
god stands in the assembly of the gods.
he stands as judge among the judges.
he says, “how long will you judge unfairly and show special favors to the wicked?” selah 
“defend the poor and orphans.
protect the rights of the poor.
help those who are poor and helpless.
save them from those who are evil.
“they don’t know what is happening.
they don’t understand!
they don’t know what they are doing.
their world is falling down around them!” 
i, god most high, say, “you are gods, my own sons.
but you will die as all people must die.
your life will end like that of any ruler.” 
get up, god!
you be the judge!
you be the leader over all the nations!
chapter 6.
then i turned around.
i looked up and saw four chariots going between two bronze mountains.
red horses were pulling the first chariot.
black horses were pulling the second chariot.
white horses were pulling the third chariot, and horses with red spots were pulling the fourth chariot.
i asked the angel who was talking with me, “sir, what does this mean?” 
the angel said, “these are the four winds.
they have just come from the lord of the whole world.
the black horses will go north, the red horses will go east, the white horses will go west, and the horses with red spots will go south.” 
the red spotted horses were anxious to go look at their part of the earth, so the angel told them, “go walk through the earth.” so they went walking through their part of the earth.
then he shouted at me and said, “look, those horses that were going north finished their job in babylon.
they have calmed my spirit; i am not angry now!” 
then i received another message from the lord.
he said, 
“heldai, tobijah, and jedaiah have come from the captives in babylon.
get silver and gold from these men and then go to the house of josiah son of zephaniah.
use the silver and gold to make a crown.
put it on the head of the high priest, joshua son of jehozadak.
then tell him this is what the lord all-powerful says: ‘there is a man called the branch.
he will grow strong, and he will build the lord’s temple.
he will build the lord’s temple, and he will receive the honor.
he will sit on his throne and be the ruler, and a priest will stand by his throne.
these two men will work together in peace.’ 
the crown will be kept in my temple, so that when people see it, they will remember heldai, tobijah, jedaiah, and the kindness of zephaniah’s son josiah.” 
people living far away will come and build the lord’s temple.
then you will know for sure that the lord all-powerful sent me to you people.
all these things will happen if you do what the lord your god says.
chapter 1.
long ago, during the time the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man named elimelech left the town of bethlehem in judah.
he, his wife, and his two sons moved to the country of moab.
the man’s wife was named naomi, and his two sons were named mahlon and kilion.
they were from the ephrathah family of bethlehem in judah.
the family traveled to the hill country of moab and stayed there.
later, naomi’s husband, elimelech, died, so only naomi and her two sons were left.
her sons married women from the country of moab.
one wife’s name was orpah, and the other wife’s name was ruth.
they lived in moab about ten years; 
then mahlon and kilion also died.
so naomi was left alone without her husband or her two sons.
while naomi was in the country of moab, she heard that the lord had helped his people.
he had given food to his people in judah.
so naomi decided to leave the hill country of moab and go back home.
her daughters-in-law also decided to go with her.
they left the place where they had been living and started walking back to the land of judah.
then naomi told her daughters-in-law, “each of you should go back home to your mother.
you have been very kind to me and my sons who are now dead.
so i pray that the lord will be just as kind to you.
i pray that the lord will help each of you find a husband and a good home.” naomi kissed her daughters-in-law, and they all started crying.
then the daughters said, “but we want to come with you and go to your family.” 
but naomi said, “no, daughters, go back to your own homes.
why should you go with me?
i can’t have any more sons to be your husbands.
go back home.
i am too old to have a new husband.
even if i thought i could be married again, i could not help you.
if i became pregnant tonight and had two sons, 
you would have to wait until they grew to become men before you could marry them.
i cannot make you wait that long for husbands.
that would make me very sad.
and i am already sad enough—the lord has done many things to me!” 
so again they cried very much.
then orpah kissed naomi goodbye, but ruth hugged her and stayed.
naomi said, “look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her own people and her own gods.
you should do the same.” 
but ruth said, “don’t force me to leave you!
don’t force me to go back to my own people.
let me go with you.
wherever you go, i will go.
wherever you sleep, i will sleep.
your people will be my people.
your god will be my god.
where you die, i will die, and that is where i will be buried.
i ask the lord to punish me if i don’t keep this promise: only death will separate us.” 
naomi saw that ruth wanted very much to go with her.
so naomi stopped arguing with her.
naomi and ruth traveled until they came to the town of bethlehem.
when the two women entered bethlehem, all the people were very excited.
they said, “is this naomi?” 
but naomi told the people, “don’t call me naomi; call me marah.
use this name because god all-powerful has made my life very sad.
i had everything i wanted when i left, but now, the lord brings me home with nothing.
the lord has made me sad, so why should you call me ‘happy’?
god all-powerful has given much trouble to me.” 
so naomi and her daughter-in-law ruth, the moabite, came back from the hill country of moab.
these two women came to bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
chapter 19.
then job answered: 
“how long will you hurt me and crush me with your words?
you have insulted me ten times now.
you have attacked me without shame!
even if i have sinned, it is my problem, not yours!
you want me to look bad to make yourselves look good.
you say my troubles are proof that i did wrong.
i want you to know it was god who did this.
he set this trap for me.
i shout, ‘he hurt me!’ but get no answer.
no one hears my cry for fairness.
god has blocked my way to keep me from getting through.
he has hidden my path in darkness.
he took away my honor.
he took the crown from my head.
he hits me on every side until i am worn out.
he takes away my hope.
it is like a tree pulled up by the roots.
his anger burns against me.
he treats me like an enemy.
he sends his army to attack me.
they build attack towers around me.
they camp around my tent.
“god has made my brothers hate me.
those who knew me have become strangers.
my relatives have left me.
my friends have forgotten me.
my servant girls and visitors in my home look at me as if i am a stranger and a foreigner.
i call for my servant, but he does not answer.
even if i beg for help, he will not answer.
my wife hates the smell of my breath.
my own brothers hate me.
even little children make fun of me.
when i get up, they say bad things about me.
all my close friends hate me.
even my loved ones have turned against me.
“i am so thin, my skin hangs loose on my bones.
i have little life left in me.
“pity me, my friends, pity me, because god is against me.
why do you persecute me as god does?
don’t you get tired of hurting me?
“i wish someone would write down everything i say.
i wish my words were written on a scroll.
i wish they were carved with an iron tool into lead or scratched on a rock so that they would last forever.
i know that there is someone to defend me and that he lives!
and in the end, he will stand here on earth and defend me.
after i leave my body and my skin has been destroyed, i know i will still see god.
i will see him with my own eyes.
i myself, not someone else, will see god.
and i cannot tell you how excited that makes me feel!
“maybe you will say, ‘how can we push job a little harder and make him realize that he is the source of his problems?’ 
but you need to worry about your own punishment.
god might use the sword against you!
then you will know there is a time for judgment.” 
job.
chapter 39.
“do you know when the mountain goats are born?
do you watch when the mother deer gives birth?
do you know how many months they must carry their babies?
do you know when it is the right time for them to be born?
these animals lie down, they feel their birth pains, and their babies are born.
their babies grow strong out in the wild.
then they leave their mothers and never come back.
“who let the wild donkeys go free?
who untied their ropes and let them loose?
i let the wild donkey have the desert for a home.
i gave the salt lands to them for a place to live.
they are happy to be away from the noise of the city.
they never have to listen to their drivers shouting at them.
they live in the mountains.
that is their pasture.
that is where they look for food to eat.
“will a wild bull agree to serve you?
will he stay in your barn at night?
will he let you put ropes on him to plow your fields?
a wild bull is very strong, but can you trust him to do your work?
can you trust him to gather your grain and bring it to your threshing place?
“an ostrich gets excited and flaps its wings, but it cannot fly.
its wings and feathers are not like the wings of a stork.
an ostrich lays her eggs on the ground and lets the sand keep them warm.
the ostrich forgets that someone might step on her eggs or that a wild animal might break them.
an ostrich leaves her little babies.
she treats them as if they were not her own.
if her babies die, she does not care that all her work was for nothing.
that’s because i did not give wisdom to the ostrich.
she is foolish, and i made her that way.
but when the ostrich gets up to run, she laughs at the horse and its rider, because she can run faster than any horse.
“did you give the horse its strength?
did you put the mane on its neck?
did you make it able to jump like a locust or snort so loudly that it scares people?
a horse is happy to be so strong.
it scratches the ground with its foot and runs into battle.
it laughs at fear; nothing makes it afraid!
it does not run away from battle.
the soldier’s quiver shakes on the horse’s side.
the spear and weapons its rider carries shine in the sun.
the horse gets very excited and races over the ground.
when it hears the trumpet blow, it cannot stand still.
when the trumpet sounds, it snorts, ‘hurray!’ it can smell the battle from far away and hear the shouts of commanders with all the other sounds of battle.
“did you teach the hawk how to spread its wings and fly south?
are you the one who told the eagle to fly high into the sky?
did you tell it to build its nest high in the mountains?
it lives high on a peak at the top of a cliff.
that is its fortress.
from there it looks far into the distance, searching for its food.
the eagles gather around dead bodies, and their young eat the blood.” 
joshua.
chapter 17.
then land was given to the tribe of manasseh.
manasseh was joseph’s first son.
manasseh’s first son was makir, the father of gilead.
makir was a great soldier, so the areas of gilead and bashan were given to his family.
land was also given to the other families in the tribe of manasseh.
these families were abiezer, helek, asriel, shechem, hepher, and shemida.
all these men were the other sons of manasseh, the son of joseph.
the families of these men got their share of the land.
zelophehad was the son of hepher.
hepher was the son of gilead.
gilead was the son of makir, and makir was the son of manasseh.
zelophehad did not have any sons, but he had five daughters.
the daughters were named mahlah, noah, hoglah, milcah, and tirzah.
the daughters went to eleazar the priest, joshua son of nun, and all the leaders.
the daughters said, “the lord told moses to give us land the same as our male relatives.” so eleazar obeyed the lord and gave the daughters some land, just like their uncles.
so the tribe of manasseh had ten areas of land west of the jordan river and two more areas of land, gilead and bashan, on the other side of the jordan river.
so these women from the tribe of manasseh got land the same as the men.
the land of gilead was given to the rest of the families of manasseh.
the lands of manasseh were in the area between asher and micmethath.
this is near shechem.
the border went south to the en tappuah area.
the land around tappuah belonged to manasseh, but the town itself did not.
the town of tappuah was at the border of manasseh’s land, and it belonged to the people of ephraim.
the border of manasseh continued south to kanah ravine.
this area belonged to the tribe of manasseh, but the cities belonged to the people of ephraim.
manasseh’s border was on the north side of the river and it continued west to the mediterranean sea.
the land to the south belonged to ephraim.
and the land to the north belonged to manasseh.
the mediterranean sea was the western border.
the border touched asher’s land in the north and issachar’s land in the east.
the people of manasseh had towns in the area of issachar and asher.
beth shean, ibleam, and the small towns around them also belonged to them.
the people of manasseh also lived in dor, endor, taanach, megiddo, and the small towns around these cities.
they also lived in the three towns of naphoth.
the people of manasseh were not able to defeat those cities.
so the canaanites continued to live there.
but the israelites grew strong.
when this happened, they forced the canaanites to work for them.
but they did not force them to leave that land.
the tribe of joseph spoke to joshua and said, “you gave us only one area of land, but we are many people.
why did you give us only one part of all the land that the lord gave his people?” 
joshua answered them, “if you have too many people, go up to the wooded area in the hill country and clear that land for a place to live.
that land now belongs to the perizzites and the rephaites.
but if the hill country of ephraim is too small for you, go take that land.” 
the people of joseph said, “it is true that the hill country of ephraim is not large enough for us.
but the canaanites living there have powerful weapons—they have iron chariots!
and they control jezreel valley, beth shean, and all the small towns in that area.” 
then joshua said to the people of joseph, the tribes of ephraim and manasseh, “you have many people and you are very strong, so you should get more than one share of the land.
you will take these mountains.
it is a forest, but you can cut down the trees and make it a good place to live.
you can take it from the canaanites and force them to leave.
you can defeat them, even if they are strong and have iron chariots.” 
isaiah.
chapter 27.
at that time the lord will judge leviathan, the crooked snake.
he will use his great sword, his hard and powerful sword, to punish leviathan, that twisting, turning snake.
he will kill the monster of the sea.
at that time people will sing about the pleasant vineyard.
“i, the lord, will care for the vineyard.
i will water it at the right time.
i will guard it day and night.
no one will hurt it.
i am not angry.
but if there is war and someone builds a wall of thornbushes, then i will march to it and burn it.
but if anyone comes to me for safety and wants to make peace with me, then let them come and make peace.
in the future, jacob will take root firmly on his soil.
then israel will sprout and bloom, and the world will be filled with his fruit.” 
israel was not hurt as badly as the enemy who tried to hurt it.
not as many of its people were killed as those who tried to kill them.
the lord will settle his argument with israel by sending the people far away.
he will speak harshly to israel.
his words will burn like the hot desert wind.
how will jacob’s guilt be forgiven?
what will happen so his sins can be taken away?
the rocks of the altar will be crushed to dust; the statues and altars for worshiping false gods will all be destroyed.
the great city will be empty; it will be like a desert.
all the people will be gone—they will run away.
the city will be like an open pasture.
young cattle will eat grass there.
the cattle will eat leaves from the branches of the vines.
the vines will become dry, and the branches will break off.
women will use them for firewood.
the people refuse to understand.
so god, their maker, will not comfort them or be kind to them.
at that time the lord will begin separating his people from others.
he will begin at the euphrates river and will gather his people from there to the river of egypt.
you people of israel will be gathered together one by one.
many of my people are now lost in assyria.
some of my people have run away to egypt.
but at that time a great trumpet will be blown, and all those people will come back to jerusalem.
they will bow down before the lord on that holy mountain.
chapter 44.
to the director: a maskil from the korah family.
god, we have heard about you.
our fathers told us what you did in their lifetime.
they told us what you did long ago.
with your great power you took this land from other people, and you gave it to us.
you crushed those foreigners and forced them to leave this land.
it was not our fathers’ swords that took the land.
it was not their strong arms that brought them victory.
it was your power.
it was because you accepted them and smiled down on them.
god, you are my king.
give the command and lead jacob’s people to victory.
we need your help to push our enemies back.
only in your name can we trample those who attacked us.
i don’t put my trust in my bow.
my sword cannot save me.
you are the one who saved us from our enemies.
you are the one who put our enemies to shame.
we have praised you all day long, and we will praise your name forever.
selah 
but you left us and put us to shame.
you did not go with us into battle.
you let our enemies push us back.
you let them take our wealth.
you gave us away like sheep to be killed and eaten.
you scattered us among the nations.
you sold your people for nothing.
you did not even argue over the price.
you made us a joke to our neighbors.
they laugh and make fun of us.
you made us one of the stories that people love to tell.
people all over the world laugh at us and shake their heads.
all i can think about is my shame.
just look at my face, and you will see it.
all i can hear are the jokes and insults of my enemies, as i watch them take their revenge.
we have not forgotten you.
but you do all those things to us.
we did not break the agreement you gave us.
we did not turn away from you.
we did not stop following you.
but you crushed us in this home of jackals.
you left us in this place as dark as death.
did we forget the name of our god?
did we pray to foreign gods?
if we did, then god knows it, because he knows our deepest secrets.
all day long we died for you.
we are like sheep being led away to be killed.
lord, wake up!
why are you sleeping?
get up!
don’t ignore us forever!
why are you hiding from us?
have you forgotten our pain and troubles?
we have been pushed down into the dirt.
we are lying face down in the dust.
get up and help us!
rescue us because of your faithful love.
2 chronicles.
chapter 23.
after six years, jehoiada showed his strength and made an agreement with the captains.
these captains were azariah son of jeroham, ishmael son of jehohanan, azariah son of obed, maaseiah son of adaiah, and elishaphat son of zicri.
they went around in judah and gathered the levites from all the towns of judah.
they also gathered the leaders of the families of israel.
then they went to jerusalem.
all the people meeting together made an agreement with the king in god’s temple.
jehoiada said to the people, “the king’s son will rule.
that is what the lord promised about david’s descendants.
now, this is what you must do: one-third of you priests and levites who go on duty on the sabbath will guard the doors.
and one-third of you will be at the king’s palace, and one-third of you will be at the foundation gate.
but all the other people will stay in the yards of the lord’s temple.
only the priests and levites who serve in the lord’s temple are permitted to enter it.
they are the only ones who have been made holy.
don’t let anyone else enter.
all the others must do only the work the lord has given them.
the levites must stay near the king.
every man must have his sword with him.
if anyone tries to enter the temple, kill that person.
you must stay with the king everywhere he goes.” 
the levites and all the people of judah obeyed all that jehoiada the priest commanded.
jehoiada the priest did not excuse anyone from the groups of the priests.
so each captain and all his men came in on the sabbath with those who went out on the sabbath.
jehoiada the priest gave the spears and the large and small shields that belonged to king david to the officers.
the weapons were kept in god’s temple.
then jehoiada told the men where to stand.
every man had his weapon in his hand.
the men stood all the way from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple.
they stood near the altar and the temple, and near the king.
they brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him.
they gave him a copy of the agreement.
then they made joash king.
jehoiada and his sons anointed joash and said, “long live the king!” 
athaliah heard the noise of the people running to the temple and praising the king.
she came into the lord’s temple to the people.
she looked and saw the king standing by his column at the front entrance.
the officers and the men who blew trumpets were near the king.
the people of the land were happy and blowing trumpets.
the singers were playing on instruments of music.
they led the people in singing praises.
then athaliah tore her clothes and said, “treason!
treason!” 
jehoiada the priest brought out the army captains.
he said to them, “take athaliah outside among the army.
use your swords to kill anyone who follows her.” then the priest warned the soldiers, “don’t kill athaliah in the lord’s temple.” 
then those men grabbed athaliah when she came to the entrance of the horse gate at the king’s palace.
then they killed her there.
then jehoiada made an agreement with all the people and the king.
they all agreed that they all would be the lord’s people.
all the people went into the temple of the idol baal and tore it down.
they also broke the altars and idols that were in baal’s temple.
they killed mattan the priest of baal in front of the altars of baal.
then jehoiada chose the priests to be responsible for the lord’s temple.
the priests were levites, and david had given them the job of being responsible for the lord’s temple.
they were to offer the burnt offerings to the lord the way the law of moses commanded.
they offered the sacrifices with much joy and singing the way david commanded.
jehoiada put guards at the gates of the lord’s temple to prevent any unclean person from entering the temple.
jehoiada took the army captains, the leaders, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land with him.
then jehoiada took the king out of the lord’s temple.
they went through the upper gate to the king’s palace and put the king on the throne.
all the people of judah were very happy, and the city of jerusalem had peace because athaliah was killed with a sword.
chapter 13.
“i have seen all this before.
i have already heard everything you say.
i understand all these things.
i know as much as you do.
i am as smart as you are.
but i don’t want to argue with you.
i want to speak to god all-powerful.
i want to argue with god about my troubles.
but you men try to cover up your ignorance with lies.
you are like worthless doctors who cannot heal anyone.
i wish you would just be quiet.
that would be the wisest thing you could do.
“now, listen to my argument.
listen to what i have to say.
will you speak lies for god?
do you really believe your lies are what god wants you to say?
are you trying to defend god against me?
you are not being fair.
you are choosing god’s side simply because he is god.
if god checked you very closely, would he see that you are right?
do you really think you can fool god the same as you fool people?
you know that god would criticize you if you chose someone’s side simply because they were important.
god’s majesty frightens you.
you are afraid of him.
the wise sayings you quote are worthless.
your arguments are as weak as clay.
“be quiet and let me talk!
i accept whatever happens to me.
i will put myself in danger and take my life in my own hands.
i will continue to trust god even if he kills me.
but i will defend myself to his face.
and if he lets me live, it will be because i had the confidence to speak.
no guilty person would dare meet god face to face.
listen carefully to what i say.
let me explain.
i am ready now to defend myself.
i will carefully present my arguments.
i know i will be shown to be right.
if anyone can prove i am wrong, i will shut up and wait to die.
“god, just give me two things, and then i will not hide from you: 
stop punishing me, and don’t frighten me with your terrors.
then call to me, and i will answer you.
or let me speak, and you answer me.
how many sins have i committed?
what wrongs have i done?
show me where i went wrong or how i sinned.
god, why do you avoid me and treat me like your enemy?
are you trying to scare me?
i am only a leaf blowing in the wind.
you are attacking a piece of straw!
you have a list of terrible charges against me.
are you making me suffer for the sins i did when i was young?
you have put chains on my feet.
you watch every step i take.
you see every move i make.
so i am becoming weaker and weaker, like a piece of wood rotting away, like a piece of cloth eaten by moths.
chapter 146.
praise the lord!
my soul, praise the lord!
i will praise the lord all my life.
i will sing praises to him as long as i live.
don’t depend on your leaders for help.
don’t depend on people, because they cannot save you.
people die and are buried.
then all their plans to help are gone.
it is a great blessing for people to have the god of jacob to help them.
they depend on the lord their god.
he made heaven and earth.
he made the sea and everything in it.
he can be trusted to do what he says.
he does what is right for those who have been hurt.
he gives food to the hungry.
the lord frees people locked up in prison.
the lord makes the blind see again.
the lord helps those who are in trouble.
the lord loves those who do right.
the lord protects strangers in our country.
he cares for widows and orphans, but he destroys the wicked.
the lord will rule forever!
zion, your god will rule forever and ever!
praise the lord!
chapter 57.
to the director: to the tune “don’t destroy.” a miktam of david written when he escaped from saul and went into the cave.
god, be merciful to me.
be kind because my soul trusts in you.
i have come to you for protection, while the trouble passes.
i pray to god most high for help, and he takes care of me completely!
from heaven he helps me and saves me.
he will punish the one who attacks me.
selah god will remain loyal to me and send his love to protect me.
my life is in danger.
my enemies are all around me.
they are like man-eating lions, with teeth like spears or arrows and tongues like sharp swords.
god, rise above the heavens!
let all the world see your glory.
my enemies set a trap for my feet to bring me down.
they dug a deep pit to catch me, but they fell into it.
selah 
god, i am ready, heart and soul, to sing songs of praise.
wake up, my soul!
harps and lyres, wake up, and let’s wake the dawn!
my lord, i will praise you before all people.
i will sing praises about you to every nation.
your faithful love is higher than the highest clouds in the sky!
rise above the heavens, god.
let all the world see your glory.
chapter 80.
to the director: to the tune “lilies of the agreement.” one of asaph’s songs of praise.
shepherd of israel, listen to us.
you lead your people like sheep.
you sit on your throne above the cherub angels.
let us see you.
shepherd of israel, show your greatness to the tribes of ephraim, benjamin, and manasseh.
come and save your people.
god, accept us again.
smile down on us and save us!
lord god all-powerful, when will you listen to our prayers?
how long will you be angry with us?
instead of bread and water, you gave your people tears.
you made us the target of everyone’s hatred.
our enemies make fun of us.
god all-powerful, accept us again.
smile down on us and save us!
when you brought us out of egypt, we were like your special vine.
you forced other nations to leave this land, and you planted that vine here.
you prepared the ground for it, and it sent its roots down deep and spread throughout the land.
it covered the mountains, and its leaves shaded even the giant cedar trees.
its branches spread to the mediterranean sea, its shoots to the euphrates river.
god, why did you pull down the walls that protect your vine?
now everyone who passes by picks its grapes.
wild pigs come and ruin it.
wild animals eat the leaves.
god all-powerful, come back.
look down from heaven at your vine and protect it.
look at the vine you planted with your own hands.
look at the young plant you raised.
our enemies have cut it down and burned it up.
show them how angry you are and destroy them.
reach out and help your chosen one.
reach out to the people you raised up.
then we will never leave you.
let us live, and we will worship you.
lord god all-powerful, accept us again.
smile down on us and save us!
chapter 8.
to the director: with the gittith.
a song of david.
lord our lord, your name is the most wonderful in all the earth!
it brings you praise everywhere in heaven.
from the mouths of children and babies come songs of praise to you.
they sing of your power to silence your enemies who were seeking revenge.
i look at the heavens you made with your hands.
i see the moon and the stars you created.
and i wonder, “why are people so important to you?
why do you even think about them?
why do you care so much about humans?
why do you even notice them?” 
but you made them almost like gods and crowned them with glory and honor.
you put them in charge of everything you made.
you put everything under their control.
people rule over the sheep and cattle and all the wild animals.
they rule over the birds in the sky and the fish that swim in the sea.
lord our lord, your name is the most wonderful name in all the earth!
chapter 2.
isaiah son of amoz received this message about judah and jerusalem.
in the last days the mountain of the lord’s temple will be the highest of all mountains.
it will be raised higher than the hills.
there will be a steady stream of people from all nations going there.
people from many places will go there and say, “come, let’s go up to the mountain of the lord, to the temple of the god of jacob.
then god will teach us his way of living, and we will follow him.” his teaching, the lord’s message, will begin in jerusalem on mount zion and will go out to all the world.
then god will act as judge to end arguments between nations.
he will decide what is right for people from many lands.
they will stop using their weapons for war.
they will hammer their swords into plows and use their spears to make tools for harvesting.
all fighting between nations will end.
they will never again train for war.
family of jacob, let us follow the lord.
family of jacob, you have abandoned your people.
this is clear because they have been filled with bad influences from the east, and now your people try to tell the future like the philistines.
they have completely accepted those strange ideas.
jacob’s land has been filled with silver and gold from other places.
there are many treasures there.
his land has been filled with horses and many chariots.
his land is full of gods that the people bow down to worship.
they made those idols themselves.
the people have become worse and worse.
they have become very low, and you leaders did nothing to lift them up!
you should be afraid of the lord!
go hide in the dirt and behind the rocks.
hide from his glorious power!
proud people will stop being proud.
they will bow down to the ground with shame, and only the lord will still stand high.
the lord all-powerful has a special day planned when he will punish the proud and boastful people.
they will be brought down.
they might be like the tall cedar trees from lebanon or the great oak trees from bashan, but they will be cut down.
they might be like the tall mountains and high hills 
or like the tall towers and high walls, but they will be brought down.
they might be like great ships from tarshish, filled with such wonderful cargo, but they will be brought down.
at that time those proud people will fall.
they will bow low to the ground, and only the lord will stand high.
all the idols will be gone.
people will go into the holes in the ground and the cracks in the rocks because they fear the lord and his great power as he stands to shake the earth.
at that time people will throw away their idols they made from gold and silver.
they made these statues to worship, but they will throw them into holes in the ground where bats and moles live.
they will go down into cracks in the rocks and boulders because they are afraid of the lord and his glorious power as he stands to shake the earth.
stop trusting other people to save you.
do not think too highly of them; they are only humans who have not stopped breathing yet.
chapter 7.
during the first year that belshazzar was king of babylon, daniel had a dream.
he saw these visions while he was lying on his bed, and he wrote what he had dreamed.
daniel said, “i saw my vision at night.
in the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions.
these winds made the sea rough.
i saw four big animals and each one was different from the others.
these four animals came up out of the sea.
“the first animal looked like a lion, but it had wings like an eagle.
as i watched, its wings were torn off.
it was helped up from the ground, and it stood up on two feet like a human.
then it was given a human mind.
“then i saw another animal there in front of me that looked like a bear.
it was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.
it was told, ‘get up and eat all the meat you want!’ 
“after that i noticed another animal in front of me.
it looked like a leopard, but it had four wings on its back.
this animal had four heads.
it was given authority to rule.
“after that, in my vision at night, i looked, and there in front of me was a fourth animal.
it looked very cruel and terrifying.
it looked very strong, with large iron teeth.
this animal crushed and ate its victims and walked on whatever was left of them.
this fourth animal was different from all the animals i saw before it.
this animal had ten horns.
“while i was looking at the horns and thinking about them, another horn grew up among them.
this was a little horn with eyes like a human.
it also had a mouth that was bragging.
then the little horn pulled out three of the other horns.
“as i was looking, thrones were put in their places, and the ancient king sat on his throne.
his clothes were as white as snow.
his hair was as white as wool.
his throne was made from fire, and its wheels were made from flames.
a river of fire flowed out from in front of the ancient king.
millions of people were serving him.
hundreds of millions of people stood in front of him.
court was ready to begin, and the books were opened.
“i kept on looking because the little horn was bragging.
i kept watching until finally the fourth animal was killed.
its body was destroyed, and it was thrown into the burning fire.
the authority and rule of the other animals had been taken from them.
but they were permitted to live for a certain period of time.
“in my vision at night i looked, and there in front of me was someone who looked like a human being.
he was coming on the clouds in the sky.
he came up to the ancient king, and the king’s servants brought him before the king.
“the one who looked like a human being was given authority, glory, and complete ruling power.
people from every nation and language group will serve him.
his rule will last forever.
his kingdom will continue forever.
it will never be destroyed.
“i, daniel, was confused and worried.
the visions that went through my mind bothered me.
i went to someone who was standing there and asked him what all this meant.
so he explained it to me.
he said, ‘the four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth.
but god’s holy people will receive the kingdom, and they will have the kingdom forever and ever.’ 
“then i wanted to know what the fourth animal was and what it meant.
the fourth animal was different from all the other animals.
it was very terrible and had iron teeth and bronze claws.
it was the animal that crushed and ate its victims and walked on whatever was left.
i wanted to know about the ten horns that were on the fourth animal’s head and about the little horn that grew there.
that little horn pulled out three of the other ten horns.
that little horn had eyes and a mouth that kept on bragging, and it looked bigger than the other horns.
as i was watching, this little horn began attacking and making war against god’s holy people and killing them.
the little horn kept killing god’s holy people until the ancient king came and judged him.
the ancient king announced his decision about the little horn.
this judgment helped god’s holy people, and they received the kingdom.
“and he explained this to me: ‘the fourth animal is a fourth kingdom that will come on the earth.
it will be different from all the other kingdoms.
that fourth kingdom will destroy people all around the world.
it will walk on and crush nations all around the world.
the ten horns are ten kings that will come from this fourth kingdom.
after those ten kings are gone, another king will come.
he will be different from the kings who ruled before him.
he will defeat three of the other kings.
this special king will say things against god most high, and he will hurt and kill god’s special people.
that king will try to change the times and laws that have already been set.
god’s holy people will be under that king’s power for three and one-half years.
“‘but the court will decide what should happen, and that king’s power will be taken away.
his kingdom will end completely.
then god’s holy people will rule over the kingdom and all the people from all the kingdoms of earth.
this kingdom will last forever, and people from all the other kingdoms will respect and serve them.’ 
“and that was the end of the dream.
i, daniel, was very afraid.
my face became very white from fear, and i did not tell the other people what i saw and heard.” 
genesis.
chapter 36.
this is the history of the family of esau (edom).
esau married women from the land of canaan.
his wives were adah, the daughter of elon the hittite, oholibamah, the daughter of anah, the son of zibeon the hivite, and 
basemath, ishmael’s daughter, the sister of nebaioth.
esau and adah had a son named eliphaz.
basemath had a son named reuel.
oholibamah had three sons: jeush, jalam, and korah.
these were esau’s sons who were born in the land of canaan.
jacob and esau’s families became too big for the land in canaan to support them all, so esau moved away from his brother jacob.
he took his wives, sons, daughters, all his slaves, cattle and other animals, and everything else that he had gotten in canaan and moved to the hill country of seir.
(esau is also named edom.)
esau is the father of the people of edom.
these are the names of esau’s family living in the hill country of seir: 
esau and adah’s son was eliphaz.
esau and basemath’s son was reuel.

all these family groups came from esau’s wife adah.
esau’s son reuel was the father of these families: nahath, zerah, shammah, and mizzah.
all these families came from esau’s wife basemath.
esau’s wife oholibamah, daughter of anah, gave birth to jeush, jalam, and korah.
these three men were the leaders of their families.
they were all sons of esau and leaders of the family groups of edom.
seir, a horite man, lived in edom before esau.
these are the sons of seir: lotan, shobal, zibeon, anah, 
dishon, ezer, and dishan.
these sons were all horite family leaders from seir in edom.
lotan was the father of hori and heman.
(timna was lotan’s sister.)
shobal was the father of alvan, manahath, ebal, shepho, and onam.

these are the names of the leaders of the horite families: lotan, shobal, zibeon, anah, 
dishon, ezer, and dishan.
these men were the leaders of the families that lived in the country of seir.
at that time there were kings in edom.
edom had kings a long time before israel did.

1 chronicles.
chapter 12.
this is a list of the men who came to david while he was at ziklag.
this was when david was hiding from saul son of kish.
these men helped david in battle.
they could shoot arrows from their bows with either their right or left hand.
they could also throw stones from their slings with either their right or left hand.
they were saul’s relatives from the tribe of benjamin.
they were 
ahiezer, their leader, and joash (sons of shemaah the gibeathite); jeziel and pelet (sons of azmaveth); beracah and jehu from the town of anathoth; 
ishmaiah the gibeonite (a hero and leader of the thirty heroes); jeremiah, jahaziel, johanan, and jozabad from the gederathites; 
eluzai, jerimoth, bealiah, and shemariah; shephatiah from haripha; 
elkanah, isshiah, azarel, joezer, and jashobeam, all from the tribe of korah; 
and joelah and zebadiah, the sons of jeroham from the town of gedor.
part of the tribe of gad joined david at his fortress in the desert.
they were brave soldiers trained for war and skilled with the shield and spear.
they looked as fierce as lions, and they could run as fast as gazelles through the mountains.
ezer was the leader of the army from the tribe of gad.
obadiah was the second in command.
eliab was the third in command.

the weakest from that group was worth 100 men, and the strongest was worth 1000 men.
they were the soldiers who crossed the jordan river in the first month of the year, when it was flooded over its banks.
they chased away the people in the valley who were on both sides of the river.
other men from the tribes of benjamin and judah also came to david at the fortress.
david went out to meet them and said, “if you have come in peace to help me, i welcome you.
join me.
but if you have come to spy on me when i have done nothing wrong, may the god of our ancestors see what you did and punish you.” 
amasai was the leader of the thirty heroes.
then the spirit came on amasai, and he said, “we are yours, david!
we are with you, son of jesse.
peace, peace to you.
peace to those who help you, because your god helps you.” so david welcomed these men into his group and put them in charge of the troops.
some of the men from the tribe of manasseh also joined david.
they joined him when he went with the philistines to fight saul.
but david and his men did not really help the philistines.
the philistine leaders talked about david helping them, but then they decided to send him away.
they said, “if david goes back to his master saul, our heads will be cut off!” 
these were the men from manasseh who joined david when he went to the town of ziklag: adnah, jozabad, jediael, michael, jozabad, elihu, and zillethai.
all of them were generals from the tribe of manasseh.
they helped david fight against bad men who were going around the country and stealing things from people.
all these men of manasseh were brave soldiers.
they became leaders in david’s army.
more and more men came every day to help david.
so he had a large and powerful army.
these are the numbers of the men who came to david at the town of hebron.
these men were ready for war.
they came to give saul’s kingdom to david.
that is what the lord said would happen.
this is their number: 
from the tribe of judah there were 6800 men ready for war.
they carried shields and spears.

they were trained to use all kinds of weapons and were very loyal to david.

they had all kinds of weapons.
all these men were brave fighters.
they came to the town of hebron for one reason—to make david king of all israel.
all the other israelites also agreed that david should be king.
the men spent three days at hebron with david.
they ate and drank, because their relatives had prepared food for them.
also, their neighbors from the areas where the tribes of issachar, zebulun, and naphtali live brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and cattle.
they brought much flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep.
the people in israel were very happy.
chapter 15.
the lord said to me, “jeremiah, even if moses and samuel were here to pray for the people of judah, i would not feel sorry for them.
send the people of judah away from me!
tell them to go!
they might ask you, ‘where will we go?’ tell them this is what the lord says: “‘i have chosen some people to die.
they will die.
i have chosen some to be killed with swords.
they will be killed with swords.
i have chosen some to die from hunger.
they will die from hunger.
i have chosen some to be taken away to a foreign country.
they will be prisoners there.
i will send four kinds of destroyers against them.’ this message is from the lord.
‘i will send the enemy with a sword to kill.
i will send the dogs to drag their bodies away.
i will send birds of the air and wild animals to eat and destroy their bodies.
i will make the people of judah an example of something terrible for all the people on earth.
i will do this to the people of judah because of what manasseh did in jerusalem.
manasseh was the son of king hezekiah.
manasseh was a king of judah.’ 
“no one will feel sorry for you, city of jerusalem.
no one will be sad and cry for you.
no one will go out of their way to even ask how you are.
jerusalem, you left me.” this message is from the lord.
“again and again you left me!
so i will punish and destroy you.
i am tired of holding back your punishment.
i will separate the people of judah with my pitchfork.
i will scatter them at the city gates of the land.
my people have not changed, so i will destroy them.
i will take away their children.
many women will lose their husbands.
there will be more widows than there is sand in the sea.
i will bring a destroyer at noontime.
the destroyer will attack the mothers of the young men of judah.
i will bring pain and fear on the people of judah.
i will make this happen very quickly.
the enemy will attack with swords and kill the people.
they will kill the survivors from judah.
a woman with seven children will lose them.
she will cry until she becomes weak and struggles to breathe.
she will be upset and confused, because her bright day has become dark.” this message is from the lord.
mother, i am sorry that you gave birth to me.
i am the one who must accuse and criticize the whole land.
i have not loaned or borrowed anything, but everyone curses me.
surely, lord, i have served you well.
in times of disaster and trouble, i prayed to you about my enemies.
“jeremiah, you know that no one can shatter a piece of iron.
i mean the kind of iron that is from the north.
and no one can shatter a piece of bronze either.
the people of judah have many treasures.
i will give these riches to other people.
they will not have to buy them, because judah has many sins.
the people sinned in every part of judah.
people of judah, i will make you slaves of your enemies.
you will be slaves in a land that you never knew.
i am very angry.
my anger is like a hot fire, and you will be burned.” 
lord, you understand me.
remember me and take care of me.
people are hurting me.
give them the punishment they deserve.
you are being patient with them.
but don’t destroy me while you remain patient with them.
think about me.
think about the pain i suffer for you.
your words came to me, and i ate them up.
they made me very happy.
i was glad to be called by your name, lord god all-powerful.
i never sat with the crowd as they laughed and had fun.
i sat by myself because of your influence on me.
you filled me with anger at the evil around me.
i don’t understand why i still hurt.
i don’t understand why my wound is not cured and cannot be healed.
i think you have changed.
you are like a spring of water that became dry.
you are like a spring whose water has stopped flowing.
then the lord said, “jeremiah, if you change and come back to me, i will not punish you.
if you change and come back to me, then you may serve me.
if you speak important things, not worthless words, then you may speak for me.
the people of judah should change and come back to you.
but don’t you change and be like them.
i will make you strong.
the people will think you are strong, like a wall made of bronze.
the people of judah will fight against you, but they will not defeat you.
they will not defeat you, because i am with you.
i will help you, and i will save you.” this message is from the lord.
“i will save you from these evil people.
they frighten you, but i will save you from them.” 
nehemiah.
chapter 5.
many of the poor people began to complain against their fellow jews.
some of them were saying, “we have many children.
we must get some grain if we are going to eat and stay alive.” 
other people were saying, “this is a time of famine.
we have to use our fields, vineyards, and homes to pay for grain.” 
and still other people were saying, “we have to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.
but we cannot afford to pay, so we are borrowing money to pay the tax.
we are as good as the others.
our sons are as good as their sons.
but we will have to sell our sons and daughters as slaves.
some of us have already had to sell our daughters as slaves.
there is nothing we can do.
we have already lost our fields and vineyards.
other people own them now.” 
when i heard their complaints, i was very angry.
i calmed myself down, and then i went to the rich families and the officials.
i told them, “you are forcing your own people to pay interest on the money you loan them.
you must stop doing that!” then i called for all the people to meet together 
and said to them, “our fellow jews were sold as slaves to people in other countries.
we did our best to buy them back and make them free.
and now, you are selling them like slaves again!” the rich people and officials kept quiet.
they could not find anything to say.
so i continued speaking.
i said, “what you people are doing is not right!
you know that you should fear and respect our god.
you should not do the shameful things other people do!
my men, my brothers, and i are also lending money and grain to the people.
but let’s stop forcing them to pay interest on these loans.
you must give their fields, vineyards, olive fields, and houses back to them, right now!
and you must give back the interest you charged them.
you charged them one percent for the money, grain, new wine, and oil that you loaned them.” 
then the rich people and the officials said, “we will give it back and not demand anything more from them.
nehemiah, we will do as you say.” then i called the priests.
i made the rich people and the officials promise to god that they would do what they said.
then i shook out the folds of my clothes.
i said, “god will do the same thing to everyone who does not keep their promise.
god will shake them out of their houses and they will lose everything they worked for.
they will lose everything!” i finished saying these things and all the people agreed.
they all said, “amen” and praised the lord.
so the people did as they had promised.
and also, during the whole time that i was appointed to be governor in the land of judah, neither my brothers nor i ate the food that was allowed for the governor.
i never forced the people to pay taxes to buy my food.
i was governor from the 20th year until the 32nd year that artaxerxes was king.
i was governor of judah for twelve years.
but the governors who ruled before me made life hard for the people.
the governors forced everyone to pay 1 pound of silver.
they also made the people give them food and wine.
the leaders under these governors also ruled over the people and made life even harder.
but i respected and feared god, so i didn’t do things like that.
i worked hard at building the wall of jerusalem.
all my men gathered there to work on the wall.
we didn’t take any land from anyone.
also, i regularly fed 150 jews who were always welcome at my table, and i fed those who came to us from the nations around us.
every day i prepared this much food for the people who ate at my table: one ox, six good sheep, and different kinds of birds.
every ten days all kinds of wine were brought to my table.
but i never demanded that they give me the food that was allowed for the governor.
i knew that the work the people were doing was very hard.
my god, remember all the good i have done for these people.
chapter 11.
then the spirit carried me to the east gate of the lord’s temple.
this gate faces the east, where the sun comes up.
i saw 25 men there at the entrance of this gate.
some of the leaders were among them, including jaazaniah son of azzur and pelatiah son of benaiah.
then god spoke to me and said, “son of man, these are the men who make evil plans for this city.
they always tell the people to do evil things.
these men say, ‘we will be building our houses again very soon.
we are as safe in this city as meat in a pot!’ 
so you must speak to the people for me.
son of man, prophesy against the people.” 
then the spirit of the lord came on me.
he said to me, “tell them that this is what the lord said: house of israel, you are planning big things.
but i know what you are thinking.
you have killed many people in this city.
you have filled the streets with dead bodies.
now, the lord god says this: ‘the dead bodies are the meat, and the city is the pot.
but someone will come and take you out of this safe pot.
you are afraid of the sword, but i am bringing the sword against you!’” this is what the lord god said.
he also said, “i will take you out of this city and give you to strangers.
i will punish you.
you will die by the sword.
i will punish you here in israel, so you will know that i am the lord.
yes, this place will be the cooking pot, and you will be the meat cooking in it.
i will punish you here in israel.
then you will know that i am the lord.
it was my law that you broke.
you did not obey my commands.
you decided to live like the nations around you.” 
as soon as i finished speaking for god, pelatiah son of benaiah died!
i fell to the ground.
i bowed with my face touching the ground and said, “oh, lord god, you are going to completely destroy all the survivors of israel!” 
but then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, remember your brothers, the family of israel.
they were forced to leave their country, but i will bring them back.
but now, the people living in jerusalem are saying, ‘stay far away from the lord.
this land was given to us—it is ours!’ 
“so tell them this: the lord god says, ‘it is true, i forced my people to go far away to other nations.
i did scatter them among many countries.
but i will be their temple for a short time while they are in those other countries.
but you must tell those people that the lord god will bring them back.
i have scattered you among many nations, but i will gather you together and bring you back from those nations.
i will give the land of israel back to you.
when my people come back, they will destroy all the terrible, filthy idols that are here now.
i will bring them together and make them like one person.
i will put a new spirit in them.
i will take away that heart of stone, and i will put a real heart in its place.
then they will obey my laws and my commands.
they will do the things i tell them.
they will be my people, and i will be their god.’” 
then god said, “but now, their hearts belong to those terrible, filthy idols, and i must punish those people for the bad things they have done.” this is what the lord god said.
then the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air.
the wheels went with them.
the glory of the god of israel was above them.
the glory of the lord rose into the air and left the city and stopped on the hill east of jerusalem.
then the spirit lifted me into the air and brought me back to babylonia.
it brought me back to the people who were forced to leave israel.
i saw all this in the vision from god.
then the one i saw in the vision rose into the air and left me.
then i spoke to the people in exile.
i told them about everything the lord showed me.
chapter 30.
the lord said, “look at these children.
they don’t obey me.
they make plans, but they don’t ask me to help them.
they make agreements with other nations, but my spirit does not want those agreements.
these people are adding more and more sins to the ones they have already done.
they are going down to egypt for help, but they did not ask me if that was the right thing to do.
they hope they will be saved by the pharaoh.
they want egypt to protect them.
“but i tell you, hiding in egypt will not help you.
pharaoh will not be able to protect you.
your leaders have gone to zoan, and your representatives have gone to hanes.
but they will be disappointed.
they are depending on a nation that cannot help them.
egypt is useless—it will not help.
egypt will bring nothing but shame and embarrassment.” 
this is a message about the negev animals: there is a dangerous place full of lions, adders, deadly snakes, and useless people.
and there are people who load their wealth onto donkeys and their treasures on the backs of camels.
they carry them to a people who cannot help.
that useless nation is egypt.
egypt’s help is worth nothing, so i call egypt the “do-nothing dragon.” 
now write this on a sign so that all people can see it, and write this in a book.
write these things for a future time.
this will be far, far in the future: 
these people are like children who refuse to obey.
they lie and refuse to listen to the lord’s teachings.
they tell the prophets, “don’t see dreams about things we should do.
don’t tell us the truth.
say nice things to us and make us feel good.
see only good things for us.
stop seeing things that will really happen.
get out of our way.
stop telling us about the holy one of israel.” 
the holy one of israel says, “you people have refused to accept this message from me.
you depend on fighting and lies to help you.
you are guilty of these things.
so you are like a tall wall with cracks in it.
that wall will fall and break into small pieces.
you will be like a large clay jar that breaks into many small, useless pieces.
you cannot use them to get a hot coal from the fire or to get water from a pool in the ground.” 
the lord god, the holy one of israel, says, “if you come back to me you will be saved.
only by remaining calm and trusting in me can you be strong.” but you don’t want to do that.
you say, “no, we need fast horses for battle.” that is true—you will need fast horses, but only to run away because your enemy will be faster than your horses.
one enemy soldier will make threats, and a thousand of your men will run away.
and when five of them make threats, all of you will run away.
the only thing that will be left of your army will be a flagpole on a hill.
so the lord is waiting to show his mercy to you.
he wants to rise and comfort you.
the lord is the god who does the right thing, so he will bless everyone who waits for his help.
you people who live in jerusalem on mount zion will not continue crying.
the lord will hear your crying, and he will comfort you.
when he hears you, he will help you.
the lord might give you sorrow and pain like the bread and water you eat every day.
but god is your teacher, and he will not continue to hide from you.
you will see your teacher with your own eyes.
if you wander from the right path, either to the right or to the left, you will hear a voice behind you saying, “you should go this way.
here is the right way.” 
then you will take your idols covered with gold and silver and make them unfit to be used again.
you will throw them away like filthy rags and say, “go away!” 
at that time the lord will send you rain.
you will plant seeds, and the ground will grow food for you.
you will have a very large harvest.
you will have plenty of food in the fields for your animals.
there will be large fields for your sheep.
your cattle and donkeys will have all the food they need.
there will be much food.
you will have to use shovels and pitchforks to spread all the food for your animals to eat.
every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water.
these things will happen after many people are killed and the enemy’s towers are pulled down.
at that time the light from the moon will be as bright as the sun, and the light from the sun will be seven times brighter than it is now.
one day of sunlight will be like a whole week’s worth.
this will happen when the lord bandages his broken people and heals the hurts from their beatings.
the lord is coming from far away.
his anger is like a fire with thick clouds of smoke.
his mouth is filled with anger, and his tongue is like a burning fire.
his breath is like a great river that rises until it reaches the throat.
he will judge the nations as if putting them through a strainer that separates the ones fit for destruction.
he will put a bit in their mouths to lead them to the place they don’t want to go.
you will sing happy songs, like the nights when you begin a festival.
you will be very happy walking to the lord’s mountain and listening to the flute on the way to worship the rock of israel.
the lord will cause all people to hear his great voice and to see his powerful arm come down in anger.
that arm will be like a great fire that burns everything.
his power will be like a great storm with much rain and hail.
assyria will be frightened by the lord’s voice and the stick that will beat him.
and as the lord beats assyria, his people will keep the rhythm with their drums and harps.
topheth has been made ready for a long time.
it is ready for the king.
it was made very deep and wide.
there is a very big pile of wood and fire there, and the lord’s breath will come like a stream of burning sulfur to start the fire.
2 kings.
chapter 4.
a man from the group of prophets had a wife.
this man died, and his wife cried out to elisha, “my husband was like a servant to you.
now he is dead!
you know he honored the lord.
but he owed money to a man.
now that man is coming to take my two boys and make them his slaves!” 
elisha answered, “how can i help you?
tell me, what do you have in your house?” the woman said, “i don’t have anything in the house except a jar of olive oil.” 
then elisha said, “go and borrow bowls from all your neighbors.
they must be empty.
borrow plenty of bowls.
then go to your house and close the doors.
only you and your sons will be in the house.
then pour the oil into all the bowls.
fill them, and put them in a separate place.” 
so the woman left elisha, went into her house, and shut the door.
only she and her sons were in the house.
her sons brought the bowls to her and she poured oil.
she filled many bowls.
finally, she said to her son, “bring me another bowl.” but all the bowls were full.
one of the sons said to her, “there aren’t any more bowls.” then the oil in the jar was finished!
when she told the man of god what had happened, elisha said to her, “go, sell the oil and pay your debt.
you and your sons can live on the money that is left.” 
one day elisha went to shunem, where an important woman lived.
she asked elisha to stop and eat at her house.
so every time elisha went through that place, he stopped there to eat.
the woman said to her husband, “look, i can see that elisha is a holy man of god.
he passes by our house all the time.
please, let’s make a little room on the roof for him.
let’s put a bed in this room and a table, a chair, and a lampstand.
then when he comes to our house, he can have this room for himself.” 
one day elisha came to the woman’s house.
he went to this room and rested there.
elisha said to his servant gehazi, “call this shunammite woman.” the servant called the shunammite woman, and she stood in front of elisha.
elisha told his servant, “now say to her, ‘look, you have done your best to take care of us.
what can we do for you?
do you want us to speak to the king for you, or to the captain of the army?’” she answered, “i am fine living here among my own people.” 
elisha said to gehazi, “what can we do for her?” he answered, “i know!
she does not have a son, and her husband is old.” 
then elisha said, “call her.” so gehazi called the woman.
she came and stood at his door.
elisha said, “about this time next spring, you will be holding your own baby boy in your arms.” the woman said, “no, sir!
man of god, don’t lie to me!” 
but the woman did become pregnant and gave birth to a son that next spring, just as elisha had said.
the boy grew.
one day the boy went out into the fields to see his father and the men cutting the grain.
the boy said to his father, “oh, my head!
my head hurts!” the father said to his servant, “carry him to his mother!” 
the servant took the boy to his mother.
the boy sat on his mother’s lap until noon.
then he died.
the woman laid the boy on the bed of elisha, the man of god.
then she shut the door to that room and went outside.
she called to her husband and said, “please send me one of the servants and a donkey.
then i will go quickly to get the man of god and come back.” 
the woman’s husband said, “why would you want to go to the man of god today?
it isn’t the new moon or sabbath day.” she said, “goodbye!” 
then she put a saddle on a donkey and said to her servant, “let’s go, and hurry!
go slow only when i tell you.” 
the woman went to mount carmel to get the man of god.
the man of god saw the shunammite woman coming from far away and said to his servant gehazi, “look, there’s the shunammite woman!
please run now to meet her!
say to her, ‘are you all right?
is your husband all right?
is the child all right?’” she answered, “everything is all right.” 
but the shunammite woman went up the hill to the man of god.
she bowed down and touched elisha’s feet.
gehazi came near to pull her away.
but the man of god said to gehazi, “leave her alone!
she’s very upset, and the lord didn’t tell me about it.
he hid this news from me.” 
then she said, “sir, i never asked for a son.
i told you, ‘don’t trick me!’” 
then elisha said to gehazi, “get ready to go.
take my walking stick and go!
if you meet anyone along the way, don’t even stop to say hello to him.
if anyone says hello to you, don’t answer.
put my walking stick on the child’s face.” 
but the child’s mother said, “i promise, as the lord lives and as you live, i will not leave without you!” so elisha got up and followed her.
gehazi arrived at the house before elisha and the shunammite woman.
gehazi laid the walking stick on the child’s face, but the child did not talk or show any sign that he heard anything.
then gehazi came back to meet elisha and said, “the child will not wake up!” 
elisha went into the house, and there was the child, lying dead on his bed.
elisha went into the room and shut the door.
he and the child were alone in the room now.
then he prayed to the lord.
elisha went to the bed and lay on the child.
he put his eyes on the child’s eyes, his mouth on the child’s mouth, and his hands on the child’s hands.
he lay there on top of the child until the child’s body became warm.
then elisha turned away and walked around the room.
he went back and lay on the child until the child sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
elisha called gehazi and said, “call the shunammite woman!” gehazi called her, and she came to elisha.
elisha said, “pick up your son.” 
then the shunammite woman went into the room and bowed down at elisha’s feet.
then she picked up her son and went out.
elisha went to gilgal again.
there was a famine in the land.
the group of prophets was sitting in front of elisha.
elisha said to his servant, “put the large pot on the fire, and make some soup for the group of prophets.” 
one man went out into the field to gather herbs.
he found a wild vine and picked the fruit from it.
he put that fruit in his robe and brought it back.
he cut up the wild fruit and put it into the pot.
but the group of prophets did not know what kind of fruit it was.
then they poured some of the soup for the men to eat.
but when they began to eat the soup, they shouted out, “man of god!
there’s poison in the pot!” the food tasted like poison, so they could not eat that food.
but elisha said, “bring some flour.” he threw the flour into the pot.
then he said, “pour the soup for the people so that they can eat.” and there was nothing wrong with the soup.
a man from baal shalishah came and brought bread from the first harvest to the man of god.
this man brought 20 loaves of barley bread and fresh grain in his sack.
then elisha said, “give this food to the people, so that they can eat.” 
elisha’s servant said, “what?
there are 100 men here.
how can i give this food to all those men?” but elisha said, “give the food to the people to eat.
the lord says, ‘they will eat and there will still be food left over.’” 
then elisha’s servant put the food in front of the group of prophets.
the group of prophets had enough to eat, and they even had food left over.
this happened just as the lord had said.
chapter 32.
the people saw that a long time had passed and moses had not come down from the mountain.
so they gathered around aaron.
they said to him, “look, moses led us out of the land of egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him.
so make us some gods to go before us and lead us.” 
aaron said to the people, “bring me the gold earrings that belong to your wives, sons, and daughters.” 
so the people collected all their gold earrings and brought them to aaron.
he took the gold from the people and used it to make an idol.
using a special tool, he shaped the gold into a statue of a calf.
then the people said, “israel, here are your gods!
these are the gods that brought you out of the land of egypt!” 
aaron saw all these things, so he built an altar in front of the calf.
then aaron made an announcement.
he said, “tomorrow will be a special festival to honor the lord.” 
the people woke up very early the next morning.
they killed animals and offered them as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
they sat down to eat and drink.
then they got up and had a wild party.
at the same time, the lord said to moses, “go down from this mountain.
your people, the people you brought out of the land of egypt, have committed a terrible sin.
they have very quickly turned away from what i commanded them to do.
they made a calf from melted gold for themselves.
they are worshiping that calf and making sacrifices to it.
the people have said, ‘israel, these are the gods that led you out of egypt.’” 
the lord said to moses, “i have seen these people, and i know that they are very stubborn.
they will always turn against me.
so now let me destroy them in anger.
then i will make a great nation from you.” 
but moses begged the lord his god, “lord, don’t let your anger destroy your people.
you brought them out of egypt with your great power and strength.
but if you destroy your people, the egyptians will say, ‘god planned to do bad things to his people.
that is why he led them out of egypt.
he wanted to kill them in the mountains.
he wanted to wipe them off the earth.’ so don’t be angry with your people.
please change your mind!
don’t destroy them.
remember abraham, isaac, and israel.
these men served you, and you used your name to make a promise to them.
you said, ‘i will make your people as many as the stars in the sky.
i will give your people all this land as i promised.
this land will be theirs forever.’” 
so the lord felt sorry for the people.
he did not do what he said he might do—he did not destroy them.
then moses went down the mountain.
he had the two stone tablets with the agreement on them.
the commandments were written on both sides of the stone, front and back.
god himself made the stones, and god himself wrote the commandments on them.
joshua heard the noise from the party in camp.
he said to moses, “it sounds like war down in the camp!” 
moses answered, “it is not the noise of an army shouting for victory.
and it is not the noise of an army crying from defeat.
the noise i hear is the sound of music.” 
when moses came near the camp, he saw the golden calf and the people dancing.
he became very angry, and he threw the stone tablets on the ground.
the stones broke into several pieces at the bottom of the mountain.
then moses destroyed the calf that the people had made.
he melted it in the fire.
then he ground the gold until it became dust and threw it into the water.
then he forced the israelites to drink that water.
moses said to aaron, “what did these people do to you that would make you do this?
why did you lead them to do such a terrible sin?” 
aaron answered, “don’t be angry, sir.
you know that these people are always ready to do wrong.
the people said to me, ‘moses led us out of egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him.
so make us some gods to lead us.’ 
so i told the people, ‘if you have any gold rings, then give them to me.’ the people gave me their gold.
i threw the gold into the fire, and out of the fire came this calf!” 
moses saw that aaron had let the people get out of control.
they were being wild, and all their enemies could see them acting like fools.
so moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “anyone who wants to follow the lord should come to me.” everyone from the tribe of levi ran to moses.
then moses said to them, “i will tell you what the lord, the god of israel, says: ‘every man must get his sword and go from one end of the camp to the other.
you men must kill those who are against the lord, even if they are your brothers, friends, or neighbors.’” 
the people from the tribe of levi obeyed moses.
that day about 3000 of the people died.
then moses said, “take your role today as special servants of the lord because you were willing to fight against even your own sons and brothers.
you will receive a blessing for this.” 
the next morning moses told the people, “you have committed a terrible sin!
but now i will go up to the lord, and maybe i can do something so that he will forgive you for your sin.” 
so moses went back to the lord and said, “please listen!
these people committed a terrible sin and made a god from gold.
now, forgive them of this sin.
if you will not forgive them, then erase my name from your book.” 
but the lord said to moses, “the only people i erase from my book are those who sin against me.
so now, go down and lead the people where i tell you to go.
my angel will go before you and lead you.
when the time comes to punish those who sinned, they will be punished.” 
so the lord caused a terrible sickness to come to the people.
he did this because they told aaron to make the golden calf.
chapter 8.
but god did not forget about noah.
god remembered him and all the animals that were with him in the boat.
god made a wind blow over the earth, and all the water began to disappear.
rain stopped falling from the sky, and water stopped flowing from under the earth.
the water that covered the earth began to go down.
after 150 days the water was low enough that the boat touched land again.
the boat stopped on one of the mountains of ararat.
this was the 17th day of the seventh month.
the water continued to go down, and by the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains were above the water.
forty days later noah opened the window he had made in the boat.
then he sent out a raven.
the raven flew from place to place until the ground was dry and the water was gone.
noah also sent out a dove.
he wanted it to find dry ground.
he wanted to know if water still covered the earth.
the dove could not find a place to rest because water still covered the earth, so the dove came back to the boat.
noah reached out his hand and caught the dove and brought it back into the boat.
after seven days noah again sent out the dove.
and that afternoon the dove came back to noah.
the dove had a fresh olive leaf in its mouth.
this was a sign to show noah that there was dry ground on the earth.
seven days later noah sent the dove out again.
but this time the dove didn’t come back.
after that noah opened the door of the boat.
he looked and saw that the ground was dry.
this was the first day of the first month of the year.
he was 601 years old.
by the 27th day of the second month, the ground was completely dry.
then god said to noah, 
“leave the boat.
you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives should go out now.
bring every living animal out of the boat with you—all the birds, animals, and everything that crawls on the earth.
these animals will make many more animals, and they will fill the earth again.” 
so noah went out with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.
all the animals, everything that crawls, and every bird left the boat.
all the animals came out of the boat in family groups.
then noah built an altar to honor the lord.
noah took some of all the clean birds and some of all the clean animals and burned them on the altar as a gift to god.
the lord smelled these sacrifices, and it pleased him.
the lord said to himself, “i will never again curse the earth as a way to punish people.
people are evil from the time they are young, but i will never again destroy every living thing on the earth as i did this time.
as long as the earth continues, there will always be a time for planting and a time for harvest.
there will always be cold and hot, summer and winter, day and night on earth.” 
nehemiah.
chapter 1.
these are the words of nehemiah son of hacaliah: i, nehemiah, was in the capital city of susa in the month of kislev.
this was in the 20th year that artaxerxes was king.
while i was in susa, one of my brothers named hanani and some other men came from judah.
i asked them about the jews who had escaped captivity and still lived in judah.
i also asked them about the city of jerusalem.
they answered, “nehemiah, the jews who escaped captivity and are in the land of judah are in much trouble.
they are having many problems and are full of shame because the wall of jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.” 
when i heard this about the people of jerusalem and about the wall, i sat down and cried.
i was very sad.
i fasted and prayed to the god of heaven for several days.
then i prayed this prayer: “lord, god of heaven, you are the great and powerful god.
you are the god who keeps his agreement of love with people who love you and obey your commands.
“please open your eyes and ears and listen to the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night.
i am praying for your servants, the israelites.
i confess the sins we israelites have done against you.
i am confessing that i have sinned against you and that the other people in my father’s family have sinned against you.
we israelites have been very bad to you.
we have not obeyed the commands, rules, and laws you gave your servant moses.
“please remember the teaching you gave your servant moses.
you said to him, ‘if you israelites are not faithful, i will force you to be scattered among the other nations.
but if you israelites come back to me and obey my commands, this is what i will do: even if your people have been forced to leave their homes and go to the ends of the earth, i will gather them from there.
and i will bring them back to the place i have chosen to put my name.’ 
“the israelites are your servants and your people.
you used your great power and rescued them.
so, lord, please listen to my prayer.
and listen to the prayers of all your other servants who are happy to honor you.
help me today as i ask the king for help.
make him pleased with me so that he will be kind and give me what i ask for.” at that time, i was the king’s wine servant.
2 samuel.
chapter 9.
david asked, “is there anyone still left in saul’s family?
i want to show kindness to this person.
i want to do it for jonathan.” 
there was a servant named ziba from saul’s family.
david’s servants called ziba to david.
king david said to ziba, “are you ziba?” ziba said, “yes, i am your servant ziba.” 
the king said, “is there anyone left in saul’s family?
i want to show god’s kindness to this person.” ziba said to king david, “jonathan has a son still living.
he is crippled in both feet.” 
the king said to ziba, “where is this son?” ziba said to the king, “he is at the house of makir son of ammiel in lo debar.” 
then king david sent some of his officers to lo debar to bring jonathan’s son from the house of makir son of ammiel.
jonathan’s son mephibosheth came to david and bowed with his face low to the floor.
david said, “mephibosheth?” mephibosheth said, “yes sir, it is i, your servant mephibosheth.” 
david said to mephibosheth, “don’t be afraid.
i will be kind to you because of your father jonathan.
i will give back to you all the land of your grandfather saul.
and you will always be able to eat at my table.” 
mephibosheth bowed to david again and he said, “i am no better than a dead dog, but you are being very kind to me.” 
then king david called saul’s servant ziba and said, “i have given saul’s family and everything he owns to your master’s grandson, mephibosheth.
you will farm the land for mephibosheth.
your sons and servants will do this for him.
you will harvest the crops.
then your master’s grandson will have plenty of food to eat, but mephibosheth will always be allowed to eat at my table.” ziba had 15 sons and 20 servants.
he said to king david, “i am your servant.
i will do everything that my lord the king commands.” so mephibosheth ate at david’s table like one of the king’s sons.
mephibosheth had a young son named mica.
all the people in ziba’s family became mephibosheth’s servants.
mephibosheth lived in jerusalem.
he was crippled in both feet, and every day he ate at the king’s table.

chapter 22.
david left gath and ran away to the cave of adullam.
david’s brothers and relatives heard that david was at adullam and went to see him there.
many people joined david.
there were men who were in some kind of trouble, men who owed a lot of money, and men who were just not satisfied with life.
all kinds of people joined david, and he became their leader.
he had about 400 men with him.
david left adullam and went to mizpah in moab.
david said to the king of moab, “please let my father and mother come and stay with you until i learn what god is going to do to me.” 
so david left his parents with the king of moab.
they stayed with the king of moab as long as david was at the fort.
but the prophet gad said to david, “don’t stay in the fort.
go to the land of judah.” so david left and went to hereth forest.
saul heard the report about david and his men while sitting under the tree on the hill at gibeah.
saul had his spear in his hand.
all of his officers were standing around him.
saul said to his officers who were standing around him, “listen, men of benjamin.
do you think that son of jesse will give you fields and vineyards?
he is not one of us, so don’t think he will give you anything or make you officers over 1000 or even 100 men!
no, but all of you are plotting against me.
none of you told me about my son jonathan and the agreement he made with the son of jesse.
none of you cares enough about me to tell me that my own son jonathan encouraged david to turn against me and attack me.
and that is what david is doing now.” 
doeg the edomite was standing there with saul’s officers.
doeg said, “i saw jesse’s son at nob.
david came to see ahimelech son of ahitub.
ahimelech prayed to the lord for david and gave him some food.
he even gave david the sword of goliath the philistine.” 
then king saul ordered some men to bring the priest to him.
saul told them to bring ahimelech son of ahitub and all his relatives who were priests at nob.
so all of them came to the king.
saul said to ahimelech, “listen now, son of ahitub.” ahimelech answered, “yes, sir.” 
saul said to him, “why did you and jesse’s son make secret plans against me?
you gave david bread and a sword.
you prayed to god for him.
and right now, david is waiting to attack me.” 
ahimelech answered, “david is very faithful to you.
not one of your other officers is as faithful as david.
he is your own son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguards.
your own family respects david.
that was not the first time i prayed to god for david.
not at all!
don’t blame me or any of my relatives.
we are your servants.
i know nothing about what is happening.” 
but the king said, “ahimelech, you and all your relatives must die.” 
then the king told the guards at his side, “go and kill the priests of the lord because they are on david’s side too.
they knew he was running away, but they didn’t tell me.” the king’s officers refused to hurt the priests of the lord.
so the king gave the order to doeg.
saul said, “doeg, you go kill the priests.” so doeg the edomite went and killed the priests.
that day he killed 85 men who were priests.
nob was the city of the priests.
doeg killed all the people of nob.
he used his sword and killed men, women, children and small babies.
he even killed their cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
but abiathar son of ahimelech escaped.
he ran away and joined david.
abiathar told david that saul had killed the lord’s priests.
then david told abiathar, “i saw doeg the edomite at nob that day.
i knew he would tell saul!
i am responsible for the death of your father’s family.
stay with me.
don’t be afraid, because the man who tried to kill you is the same man who wants to kill me.
i will protect you if you stay with me.” 
lamentations.
chapter 2.
look how the lord has covered daughter zion with the cloud of his anger.
he has thrown her, the glory of israel, from the sky to the ground.
in his anger he showed no care even for the temple where he rests his feet.
the lord destroyed the houses of jacob.
he destroyed them without mercy.
in his anger he destroyed the fortresses of daughter judah.
he threw the kingdom of judah and its rulers to the ground.
he ruined the kingdom of judah.
he was angry, and he destroyed all the strength of israel.
he took away his right hand from israel.
he did this when the enemy came.
he burned like a flaming fire in jacob.
he was like a fire that burns all around.
he bent his bow like an enemy.
he held his sword in his right hand.
he killed all the good-looking men of judah.
he killed them as if they were the enemy.
he poured out his anger like a fire on the tents of zion.
the lord has become like an enemy.
he has swallowed up israel.
he has swallowed up all her palaces and all her fortresses.
he has made much sadness and crying for the dead in daughter judah.
he pulled up his own tent as if it were a garden.
he has ruined the place where the people came together to worship him.
the lord has made people forget the special assemblies and special days of rest in zion.
he rejected the king and the priests.
he was angry and rejected them.
he rejected his altar, and he left his holy place of worship.
he let the enemy pull down the walls of the palaces of jerusalem.
the enemy shouted with joy in the lord’s temple.
they made noise as though it were a festival.
the lord planned to destroy the wall of daughter zion.
he marked the wall with a measuring line.
he didn’t stop himself from destroying it.
he made all the walls cry out in sadness.
together they wasted away.
jerusalem’s gates have sunk into the ground.
the bars on her gates are completely destroyed.
her king and princes have been taken to other nations.
the teaching of the law has stopped.
and her prophets no longer receive visions from the lord.
the elders of zion sit on the ground.
they sit on the ground and are quiet.
they pour dust on their heads.
they put on sackcloth.
the young women of jerusalem bow their heads to the ground in sorrow.
my eyes are worn out with tears, and my insides are upset.
my heart feels like it has been poured on the ground; i feel this way because of the destruction of my people.
children and babies are fainting in the public squares of the city.
they ask their mothers, “where is the bread and wine?” as they pour out their life in their mother’s laps.
my dear jerusalem, what can i say about you?
what can i compare you to?
what can i say you are like?
how can i comfort you, city of zion?
you have been hurt much too badly for anyone to heal.
your prophets saw visions for you, but their visions were only worthless lies.
they didn’t speak against your sins.
they didn’t try to make things better.
they spoke messages for you, but they were false messages that fooled you.
those who pass by on the road clap their hands and laugh at you.
they make fun of jerusalem, shaking their heads at the sight of her.
they ask, “is this the city that people called ‘the most beautiful city’ and ‘the joy of all the earth’?” 
all your enemies laugh at you.
they whistle and grind their teeth at you.
they say, “we have swallowed them up!
this is the day we were hoping for.
we have finally seen this happen!” 
the lord did what he planned to do.
he did what he said he would do.
he did what he commanded a long time ago.
he destroyed, and he had no pity.
he made your enemies happy because of what happened to you.
he made your enemies strong.
cry out with all your heart to the lord!
jerusalem, let tears roll down your walls.
let your tears flow like a stream day and night.
don’t stop crying or let your eyes dry.
get up throughout the night and cry for help.
let your sorrow pour out before the lord like water.
lift up your hands in prayer to him.
ask him to let your children live.
they are starving to death on every street corner.
look at us, lord!
have you ever treated anyone else so badly?
is it right for women to eat their own babies, the children they have cared for?
should priests and prophets be killed in the temple of the lord?
young men and old men lie on the ground in the streets of the city.
my young women and young men have been killed by the sword.
you killed them on the day of your anger.
you killed them without mercy!
you invited terror to come to me from all around.
you invited terror as though you were inviting it to a festival.
no one escaped on the day of the lord’s anger.
my enemy killed the people who i raised and brought up.
chapter 8.
the lord said to moses, 
“take aaron and his sons with him and the clothes, the anointing oil, the bull of the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread.
then gather the people together at the entrance of the meeting tent.” 
moses did what the lord commanded him.
the people met together at the entrance of the meeting tent.
then moses said to them, “this is what the lord has commanded must be done.” 
moses brought aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
moses put the woven shirt on aaron and tied the cloth belt around him.
then moses put the robe and the ephod on aaron and tied the beautiful cloth belt around him.
moses put the judgment pouch on aaron and put the urim and thummim inside its pocket.
he also put the turban on aaron’s head.
he put the strip of gold on the front of the turban.
this strip of gold is the holy crown.
moses did this just as the lord had commanded.
then moses took the anointing oil and sprinkled it on the holy tent and on everything in it.
in this way he made them holy.
he sprinkled some of the anointing oil on the altar seven times.
he sprinkled the oil on the altar, on all its tools and dishes, and on the bowl and its base.
in this way he made them holy.
he poured some of the anointing oil on aaron’s head to make him holy.
then moses brought aaron’s sons forward.
he put their woven shirts on them, tied belts around them, and put cloth caps on their heads.
he did everything just as the lord had commanded.
then moses brought out the bull of the sin offering.
aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull’s head.
then moses killed the bull and collected its blood.
he used his finger to put some of the blood on all the corners of the altar.
in this way he made the altar ready for sacrifices.
then he poured out the blood at the base of the altar to make the altar ready for sacrifices to make the people pure.
moses took all the fat from the inner parts of the bull.
he took the fat part of the liver with the two kidneys and the fat on them.
then he burned them on the altar.
moses took the bull’s skin, its meat, and its body waste outside the camp.
he burned these things in a fire outside the camp.
he did everything just as the lord commanded him.
then moses brought the ram of the burnt offering.
aaron and his sons put their hands on the ram’s head.
then moses killed the ram.
he sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
he cut the ram into pieces.
he washed the inner parts and legs with water.
then he burned the whole ram on the altar.
he burned the head, the pieces, and the fat as a burnt offering.
it was a sweet-smelling gift to the lord.
moses did everything just as the lord commanded.
then moses brought the other ram.
this ram was used for appointing aaron and his sons to become priests.
aaron and his sons put their hands on the ram’s head.
then moses killed the ram.
he put some of its blood on the tip of aaron’s ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
then moses brought aaron’s sons close to the altar.
he put some of the blood on the tip of their right ears, on the thumb of their right hands, and on the big toe of their right feet.
then he sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat on the inner parts, the fat covering of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh.
a basket of unleavened bread is put before the lord each day.
moses took one of those loaves of bread, one loaf of bread mixed with oil, and one unleavened wafer.
he put these pieces of bread on the fat and on the right thigh of the ram.
then he put all of it in the hands of aaron and his sons.
moses lifted these pieces to show he was offering them before the lord.
then moses took these things from the hands of aaron and his sons and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering.
so this was the offering for appointing aaron and his sons as priests.
it was a sweet-smelling gift to the lord.
moses took the breast and lifted it to show he had presented it to the lord.
it was moses’ share of the ram for appointing the priests.
this was just as the lord had commanded him.
moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar.
he sprinkled some on aaron and on aaron’s clothes.
he sprinkled some on aaron’s sons who were with aaron and on their clothes.
in this way moses made aaron, his clothes, his sons, and his sons’ clothes holy.
then moses said to aaron and his sons, “i told you, ‘aaron and his sons must eat these things.’ so take the basket of bread and meat from the ceremony for appointing the priests.
boil that meat at the entrance of the meeting tent.
eat the meat and bread at that place.
do this as i told you.
if any of the meat or bread is left, burn it.
the ceremony for appointing the priests will last for seven days.
you must not leave the entrance of the meeting tent until that time is finished.
everything we did today was what the lord commanded us to do in order to make you pure.
you must stay at the entrance of the meeting tent day and night for seven days.
if you don’t obey the lord’s commands, you will die!
the lord gave me these commands.” 
so aaron and his sons did everything that the lord had commanded moses.
chapter 26.
at that time people will sing this song in judah: we have a strong city with strong walls and defenses.
but god gives us our salvation.
open the gates for the good people to enter.
they are the god’s faithful followers.
god, you give true peace to people who depend on you, to those who trust in you.
so trust the lord always, because in the lord yah you have a place of safety forever.
but he will destroy the proud city and punish those who live there.
he will throw that high city down to the ground.
it will fall into the dust.
then poor and humble people will walk on those ruins.
honesty is the path good people follow.
they follow the path that is straight and true.
and god, you make that way smooth and easy to follow.
but, lord, we are waiting for your way of justice.
we want to honor you and your name.
at night my soul longs to be with you, and the spirit in me wants to be with you at the dawn of every new day.
when your way of justice comes to the world, people will learn the right way of living.
evil people will not learn to do good, even if you show them only kindness.
they will still do wrong, even if they live in a good world.
they never see the lord’s greatness.
lord, your arm is raised to punish them, but they don’t see it.
show them how strong your love is for your people.
then those who are evil will be ashamed.
yes, your fire will destroy your enemies.
lord, you have succeeded in doing everything we tried to do, so give us peace.
lord, you are our god, but in the past, we followed other lords.
we belonged to other masters, but now we want people to remember only one name—yours.
those dead lords will not come to life.
those ghosts will not rise from death.
you decided to destroy them, and you destroyed everything that makes us think about them.
lord, you have helped the nation you love.
you made our nation grow and brought honor to yourself.
lord, people remember you when they are in trouble.
so because of your punishment, we called out to you.
lord, because of you we were in pain, like a woman giving birth, who struggles and cries out when it is time.
but we struggled in pain for nothing.
we gave birth only to wind.
we did nothing to save the land.
no one was born to live in the world.
but the lord says, “your people have died, but they will live again.
the bodies of my people will rise from death.
dead people in the ground, stand and be happy!
the dew covering you is like the dew sparkling in the light of a new day.
it shows that a new time is coming, when the earth will give birth to the dead who are in it.” 
my people, go into your rooms and lock your doors.
hide in there for a short time until god’s anger is finished.
the lord is coming out from his place to judge the people of the world for the bad things they have done.
the earth will reveal the blood that has been spilled on it.
it will no longer hide the proof of those murders.
chapter 7.
so the king and haman went to eat with queen esther.
then as they were drinking wine on the second day of the party, the king again asked esther a question, “queen esther, what is it you want to ask for?
ask anything and it will be given to you.
what do you want?
i will give you anything, even half my kingdom.” 
then queen esther answered, “king, if you like me and it pleases you, please let me live.
and i ask you to let my people live too.
this is what i ask for.
i ask this because my people and i have been sold to be destroyed—to be killed and wiped out completely.
if we had just been sold as slaves, i would have kept quiet, because that would not be enough of a problem to bother the king.” 
then king xerxes asked queen esther, “who did this to you?
where is the man who dared to do such a thing to your people?” 
esther said, “the man against us, our enemy, is this wicked haman.” then haman was filled with terror before the king and queen.
the king was very angry.
he got up, left his wine, and went out into the garden.
but haman stayed inside to beg queen esther to save his life.
he begged for his life because he knew that the king had already decided to kill him.
just as the king was coming back in from the garden to the party room, he saw haman falling on the couch where esther was lying.
the king said with anger in his voice, “will you attack the queen even while i am in the house?” as soon as the king had said this, servants came in and killed haman.
one of the eunuchs who served the king was named harbona.
he said, “a hanging post 75 feet tall has been built near haman’s house.
haman had it made so that he could hang mordecai on it.
mordecai is the man who helped you when he told about the evil plans to kill you.” the king said, “hang haman on that post!” 
so they hanged haman on the hanging post he had built for mordecai.
then the king stopped being angry.
chapter 47.
“fall down and sit in the dirt, virgin daughter babylon.
you have no throne, so sit on the ground, daughter of the chaldeans.
you are not the ruler now.
you are no longer the beautiful young princess that people said you were.
get the millstones ready and grind the grain into flour.
take off your veil and fancy clothes.
lift your skirt and get ready to cross the rivers.
men will see your naked body and use you for sex.
i will make you pay for the bad things you did, and i will not let anyone help you.
“my people say, ‘god saves us.
his name is the lord all-powerful, the holy one of israel.’” 
“so babylon, sit down and shut up.
daughter of the chaldeans, go into the dark prison.
you will no longer be ‘the queen of the kingdoms.’ 
“i was angry with my people.
they were mine, but i turned against them.
i let you punish them, but you showed them no mercy.
even for those who were old you made the work hard.
you said, ‘i will live forever.
i will always be the queen.’ you didn’t care what you did to my people.
you didn’t think about what might happen later.
so now listen, you who love only pleasure!
feeling so safe, you tell yourself, ‘i alone am important, and no one else matters.
i will never be a widow or lose my children.’ 
these two things will happen to you: first, you will lose your children and then your husband.
and none of your magic spells will help you.
you do bad things but still feel safe.
you say to yourself, ‘no one sees the wrong i do.’ you thought that your wisdom and knowledge would save you.
you tell yourself, ‘i alone am important, and no one else matters.’ 
“but disaster is coming your way.
you don’t know when it will happen, but disaster is coming.
and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
you worked hard all your life learning magic and spells.
so start using that magic.
maybe those spells will help you.
maybe you will be able to frighten someone.
you have many advisors.
are you tired of the advice they give?
then send out your men who read the stars.
they can tell when the month starts, so maybe they can tell you when your troubles will come.
but they cannot even save themselves.
they will burn like straw.
they will burn so fast that there will be no coals left to cook bread.
there will be no fire left to sit by.
that’s what will happen to those you have worked with, the people you did business with all your life.
they will all go their own way.
there will be no one left to save you.” 
isaiah.
chapter 13.
god showed isaiah son of amoz this message about babylon: 
“raise a flag on that mountain where nothing grows.
call out to the men.
wave your arms to let them know they should enter through the gates for important leaders.
“i have separated these men from the people, and i myself will command them.
i have gathered these proud, happy soldiers of mine to show how angry i am.
“listen to that loud noise in the mountains.
it sounds like crowds of people.
people from many kingdoms are gathering together.
the lord all-powerful is calling his army together.
they are coming from a faraway land.
they are coming from beyond the horizon.
the lord will use this army as a weapon to show his anger.
they will destroy the whole country.” 
the lord’s special day is near.
so cry and be sad for yourselves.
a time is coming when the enemy will steal your wealth.
god all-powerful will make that happen.
people will lose their courage.
fear will make them weak.
everyone will be afraid.
they will stare at each other with shock on their faces.
fear will grip them like the pains of a woman in childbirth.
look, the lord’s special day is coming!
it will be a terrible day.
god will be very angry.
he will destroy the country and wipe out the sinful people who live there.
the skies will be dark.
the sun, the moon, and the stars will not shine.
the lord says, “i will cause bad things to happen to the world.
i will punish the evil people for their sin.
i will make proud people lose their pride.
i will stop the bragging of cruel people.
there will be only a few people left.
they will be as rare as pure gold.
in my anger i will shake the sky, and the earth will be moved from its place.” that will happen on the day the lord all-powerful shows his anger.
then the people from babylon will run away like wounded deer or sheep that have no shepherd.
everyone will turn and run back to their own country and people.
anyone caught by the enemy will be killed with a sword.
everything in their houses will be stolen.
their wives will be raped, and their little children will be beaten to death while they watch.
the lord says, “look, i will cause the armies of media to attack babylon.
nothing will stop them, even if someone offers them gold and silver.
they will walk on the bows of the young soldiers of babylon.
the enemy soldiers will not show any kindness or mercy even to the babies and young children.
babylon will be destroyed like the time god destroyed sodom and gomorrah.
“babylon is the most beautiful of all kingdoms.
the babylonians are very proud of their city.
but babylon will not continue to be beautiful.
people will not continue to live there in the future.
arabs will not put their tents there.
shepherds will not bring their sheep to let them eat there.
the only animals living there will be wild animals from the desert.
people will not be living in their houses in babylon.
the houses will be full of owls and large birds.
wild goats will play in the houses.
wild dogs and wolves will howl in the great and beautiful buildings.
babylon will be finished.
the end is near, and it will not be delayed.”

chapter 24.
after saul had chased the philistines away, people told him, “david is in the desert area near en gedi.” 
so saul chose 3000 men from all over israel and began searching for david and his men.
they looked near wild goat rocks.
saul came to some sheep pens beside the road.
there was a cave near there, so saul went in to relieve himself.
david and his men were deep inside that same cave.
david’s men told him, “this is day the lord told you about when he said, ‘i will give your enemy to you, and you can do whatever you want to him.’” so david crawled closer and closer to saul and cut off a corner of saul’s robe.
saul didn’t notice what happened.
later, david felt bad about what he did.
he said to his men, “i pray the lord never lets me do anything like that to my master again.
i must not do anything against saul, because he is the lord’s chosen king.” 
david said these things to stop his men.
he would not let his men hurt saul.
saul left the cave and went on his way.
later, david came out of the cave and called out to saul, “my lord the king!” saul looked back.
david bowed with his face to the ground to show his respect.
david said to saul, “why do you listen when people say, ‘david plans to hurt you’?
you can see that with your own eyes that is not true.
the lord put you within my grasp today in the cave, but i refused to kill you.
i was merciful to you.
i said, ‘i won’t hurt my master.
saul is the lord’s chosen king.’ 
look at this piece of cloth in my hand.
i cut off the corner of your robe.
i could have killed you, but i didn’t.
now, i want you to understand this.
i want you to know that i am not planning anything against you.
i did nothing wrong to you, but you are hunting me and trying to kill me.
let the lord be the judge.
i hope the lord will punish you for the wrong you did to me, but i won’t fight you myself.
there is an old saying: ‘bad things come from bad people.’ “i haven’t done anything bad, and i won’t hurt you.
who are you chasing?
did the king of israel bring an army to chase a single flea or a dying dog?
let the lord be the judge.
let him decide between you and me.
he will support me and show that i am right.
he will save me from you.” 
when david finished speaking, saul asked, “is that your voice, david my son?” then saul lifted his voice and began to cry.
he said, “you are right, and i am wrong.
you were good to me, even though i have been bad to you.
you yourself said it when you told me about the good things you did.
the lord put my life in your hands, but you did not kill me.
this shows that you are not my enemy.
a man doesn’t catch his enemy, and then just let him go.
he doesn’t do good things for his enemy.
may the lord reward you for being good to me today.
now, i know that you will become the new king.
you will rule the kingdom of israel.
now make a promise to me with an oath using the lord’s name.
promise that you will not kill my descendants, even after i die.
promise me that you will not erase my name from my father’s family.” 
so david made a promise to saul.
he promised that he would not kill saul’s family.
then saul went back home.
david and his men went back up to the fort.
1 samuel.
chapter 31.
meanwhile, the philistines fought against the israelites, and the israelites ran from them.
there were many dead bodies that fell at mount gilboa.
the philistines fought hard against saul and his sons.
they killed jonathan, abinadab, and malki shua.
the battle grew even more intense around saul.
the archers closed in on saul and wounded him with many arrows.
saul told the boy who carried his armor, “take your sword and kill me or else these foreigners will do it and torment me as well!” but saul’s helper was afraid and refused to kill him.
so saul took out his own sword and fell on it.
when the helper saw that saul was dead, he took out his own sword, fell on it, and died there with saul.
so saul, his three sons, and the boy who carried his armor all died together that day.
the israelites who lived on the other side of the valley saw the israelite army running away.
they saw that saul and his sons were dead, so they left their cities and ran away.
then the philistines came and lived in their cities.
the next day, the philistines went back to take things from the dead bodies.
they found saul and his three sons dead on mount gilboa.
the philistines cut off saul’s head and took all his armor.
they carried the news to the philistines and to all the temples of their idols.
they put saul’s armor in the temple of ashtoreth.
the philistines also hung saul’s body on the wall of beth shan.
the people living in jabesh gilead heard what the philistines did to saul.
so all the soldiers of jabesh went to beth shan.
they marched all night, went to the wall of beth shan, and took down the bodies of saul and his sons.
then they carried them to jabesh.
there the people of jabesh burned the bodies of saul and his three sons.
later, they buried the bones of saul and his three sons under the big tree in jabesh.
then the people of jabesh showed their sadness—they did not eat for seven days.
chapter 10.
israel is like a vine that grows plenty of fruit.
but as israel got more and more things, he built more and more altars to honor false gods.
his land became better and better, so he put up better and better stones to honor false gods.
the people of israel tried to trick god, but now they must accept their guilt.
he will break down their altars and destroy their memorial stones.
now the israelites say, “we have no king.
we don’t honor the lord.
and his king cannot do anything to us.” 
they make promises, but they are only telling lies.
they don’t keep their promises.
they make agreements with other countries.
god does not like those agreements.
the judges are like poisonous weeds growing in a plowed field.
the people from samaria worship the calves at beth aven.
they will cry.
the priests will cry, because their beautiful idol is gone.
it was carried away.
it was carried away as a gift to the great king of assyria.
he will keep ephraim’s shameful idol.
israel will be ashamed of its idol.
samaria’s false god will be destroyed.
it will be like a piece of wood floating away on the water’s surface.
israel sinned and built many high places.
the high places of aven will be destroyed.
thorns and weeds will grow on their altars.
then they will say to the mountains, “cover us!” and to the hills, “fall on us!” 
“israel, you have sinned since the time of gibeah.
(and the people have continued to sin there.)
those evil people at gibeah will be trapped by war.
i will come to punish them.
armies will come together against them and punish the israelites for both of their sins.
“ephraim is like a trained young cow that loves to walk on grain on the threshing floor.
i will put a good yoke on her neck.
i will put the ropes on ephraim.
then judah will begin plowing.
jacob will break the ground himself.” 
if you plant goodness, you will harvest faithful love.
plow your ground, and you will harvest with the lord.
he will come, and he will make goodness fall on you like rain.
but you planted evil, and you harvested trouble.
you ate the fruit of your lies, because you had trusted in your power and your soldiers.
so your armies will hear the noise of battle, and all your fortresses will be destroyed.
it will be like the time shalman destroyed beth arbel.
at that time of war, mothers were killed with their children.
and this will happen to you at bethel, because you did so many evil things.
when that day begins, the king of israel will be fully destroyed.
2 samuel.
chapter 19.
people told joab what had happened, “look, the king is crying and mourning for absalom.” 
so the joy of victory turned to sadness for everyone.
it was a very sad day because the people heard, “the king is mourning for his son.” 
the people came into the city quietly as if they were the ones who had been defeated in battle.
the king had covered his face and was crying loudly, “o my son absalom, o absalom, my son, my son!” 
joab came into the king’s palace and said to the king, “you are humiliating every one of your officers!
look, they saved your life today and the lives of your sons and daughters and your wives and slave women.
it seems that you love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you!
today you have made it clear to your officers and men that they mean nothing to you.
it appears as if you would have been perfectly happy if absalom had lived and the rest of us had been killed today!
now get up and go encourage your officers.
i swear by the lord, if you don’t go out and do that right now, not one man will be with you tonight.
and that will be worse for you than all the trouble you have had since you were a child.” 
so the king went to the city gate.
the news spread that the king was at the gate, so all the people came to see him, except for the israelites who had run away to their homes.
the tribes of israel began discussing what to do next.
they said, “king david saved us from the philistines and our other enemies.
david left the country because he was running away from absalom.
we anointed absalom to be the king, but he was killed in battle.
so we should bring david back to be the king again.” 
king david sent a message to zadok and abiathar the priests.
david said, “speak to the leaders of judah and tell them, ‘why are you the last tribe to bring king david back home?
see, all the israelites are talking about bringing the king back home.
you are my brothers, my family, so why are you the last tribe to bring the king back?’ 
also tell amasa, ‘you are part of my family.
i swear that i will make you captain of the army in joab’s place.’” 
david touched the hearts of the people of judah, and they all agreed as one.
the people of judah sent a message to the king, saying, “you and all your officers come back!” 
king david came to the jordan river.
the people of judah came to gilgal to meet the king and take him across the jordan river.
shimei son of gera, from the tribe of benjamin, lived in bahurim.
shimei rushed down to meet king david, with the rest of the people of judah.
about 1000 people from the tribe of benjamin came with shimei.
ziba the servant from saul’s family also came.
ziba brought his 15 sons and 20 servants with him.
all these people hurried to the jordan river to meet king david.
the people went across the jordan river to help bring the king’s family back to judah.
they did whatever the king wanted.
while the king was crossing the river, shimei son of gera came to meet him.
he bowed down to the ground in front of the king.
shimei said to the king, “my lord, don’t think about the wrong things i did.
my lord and king, don’t remember the bad things i did when you left jerusalem.
i know that i sinned.
that is why today i am the first person from joseph’s family to come down and meet you, my lord and king.” 
abishai son of zeruiah said, “let’s kill him for all the bad things he said about the lord’s chosen king.” 
david said, “what should i do with you, sons of zeruiah?
are you trying to cause me trouble?
no one will be put to death in israel today!
today i know that i am king over israel.” 
then the king said to shimei, “you will not die.” the king made a promise to shimei that he himself would not kill shimei.
saul’s grandson, mephibosheth, came down to meet king david.
mephibosheth had not cared for his feet, trimmed his mustache, or washed his clothes since the day the king left jerusalem.
when he met the king at jerusalem, the king said, “mephibosheth, why didn’t you go with me when i ran away from jerusalem?” 
mephibosheth answered, “my lord and king, my servant tricked me.
i am crippled so i said to my servant, ziba, ‘go saddle a donkey for me so that i can go with the king.’ 
but my servant tricked me and said bad things about me.
my lord and king, you are like an angel from god.
do whatever you think is right.
you could have killed all my grandfather’s family, but you did not do that.
instead, you included me among the people who eat at your own table.
so i don’t have a right to complain to the king about anything.” 
the king said to mephibosheth, “don’t say anything more about your problems.
this is what i have decided: you and ziba will divide the land.” 
mephibosheth said to the king, “my lord and king, it is enough that you have come home in peace.
let ziba have the land.” 
barzillai of gilead came down from rogelim to cross the jordan river with king david and send him on his way home.
barzillai was a very old man, 80 years old.
he had given the king food and other things when david was staying at mahanaim.
barzillai could do this because he was a very rich man.
david said to barzillai, “come across the river with me.
i will take care of you if you will live in jerusalem with me.” 
but barzillai said to the king, “do you know how old i am?
do you think i can go with you to jerusalem?
i am 80 years old!
i am too old to tell what is bad or good.
i cannot taste what i eat or drink or hear the voices of men and women singers.
why should you want to be bothered with me?
i don’t need any of the things that you want to give me.
i will cross the jordan river with you.
then please let me go back so that i can die in my own town and be buried in the grave of my father and mother.
but here is kimham; take him back with you as a servant, my lord and king.
do whatever you want with him.” 
the king answered, “kimham will go back with me.
i will be kind to him for you.
i will do anything for you.” 
the king kissed barzillai and blessed him.
barzillai went back home, and the king and all the people went across the river.
the king crossed the jordan river to gilgal.
kimham went with him.
all the people of judah and half the people of israel led david across the river.
all the israelites came to the king and said to him, “why did our brothers, the people of judah, steal you away?
why did they bring you and your family back across the jordan river with your men?” 
all the people of judah answered the israelites, “we did it because the king is our close relative.
why are you angry with us about this?
we have not eaten food at the king’s expense.
the king did not give us any gifts.” 
the israelites answered, “we have ten shares in david, so we have more right to david than you do.
why did you ignore us?
we were the first ones to talk about bringing our king back.” but the people of judah replied with words that were even louder and angrier than those of the israelites.
chapter 33.
jacob looked and saw esau coming with 400 men.
jacob divided his family into four groups.
leah and her children were in one group, rachel and joseph were in one group, and the two maids and their children were in two groups.
jacob put the maids with their children first.
then he put leah and her children behind them, and he put rachel and joseph in the last place.
jacob himself went out before them.
while he was walking toward his brother esau, he bowed down to the ground seven times.
when esau saw jacob, he ran to meet him.
he put his arms around jacob, hugged his neck, and kissed him.
then they both cried.
esau looked up and saw the women and children.
he said, “who are all these people with you?” jacob answered, “these are the children that god gave me.
god has been good to me.” 
then the two maids and the children with them went to esau.
they bowed down before him.
then leah and the children with her went to esau and bowed down.
and then rachel and joseph went to him and bowed down.
esau said, “who were all those people i saw while i was coming here?
and what were all those animals for?” jacob answered, “these are my gifts to you so that you might accept me.” 
but esau said, “you don’t have to give me gifts, brother.
i have enough for myself.” 
jacob said, “no, i beg you!
if you really accept me, please accept the gifts i give you.
i am very happy to see your face again.
it is like seeing the face of god.
i am very happy to see that you accept me.
so i beg you to also accept the gifts i give you.
god has been very good to me.
i have more than i need.” because jacob begged esau to take the gifts, he accepted them.
then esau said, “now you can continue your journey.
i will go with you.” 
but jacob said to him, “you know that my children are weak.
and i must be careful with my flocks and their young animals.
if i force them to walk too far in one day, all the animals will die.
so you go on ahead.
i will follow you slowly.
i will go slowly enough for the cattle and other animals to be safe and so that my children will not get too tired.
i will meet you in seir.” 
so esau said, “then i will leave some of my men to help you.” but jacob said, “that is very kind of you, but there is no need to do that.” 
so that day esau started on his trip back to seir.
but jacob went to succoth.
there he built a house for himself and small barns for his cattle.
that is why the place was named succoth.
jacob safely ended his trip from paddan aram when he came to the town of shechem in canaan.
he made his camp in a field near the city.
he bought the field where he camped from the family of hamor, father of shechem.
he paid 100 pieces of silver for it.
he built an altar there to honor god.
he named the place “el, the god of israel.” 
isaiah.
chapter 7.
ahaz was the son of jotham, who was the son of uzziah.
rezin was the king of aram, pekah son of remaliah was the king of israel.
when ahaz was king of judah, rezin and pekah went up to jerusalem to attack it, but they were not able to defeat the city.
the family of david received a message that said, “the armies of aram and ephraim have joined together in one camp.” when king ahaz heard this message, he and the people became frightened.
they shook with fear like trees of the forest blowing in the wind.
then the lord told isaiah, “you and your son shear jashub should go out and talk to ahaz.
go to the place where the water flows into the upper pool, on the street that leads up to laundryman’s field.
“tell ahaz, ‘be careful, but be calm.
don’t be afraid.
don’t let those two men, rezin and remaliah’s son, frighten you!
they are like two burning sticks.
they might be hot now, but soon they will be nothing but smoke.
rezin, aram, and remaliah’s son became angry 
and made plans against you.
they said, 
“let’s go fight against judah and divide it among ourselves.
then we will make tabeel’s son the new king of judah.”’” 
but the lord god says, “their plan will not succeed.
it will not happen 
because aram depends on its capital damascus, and damascus is led by its weak king rezin.
and don’t worry about ephraim.
within 65 years it will be crushed, no longer a nation.
ephraim depends on its capital samaria, and samaria is led by remaliah’s son.
so you have no reason to fear.
believe this, or you will not survive.” 
then the lord spoke to ahaz again 
and said, “ask for a sign from the lord your god to prove to yourself that this is true.
you can ask for any sign you want.
the sign can come from a place as deep as sheol or as high as the skies.” 
but ahaz said, “i will not ask for a sign as proof.
i will not test the lord.” 
then isaiah said, “family of david, listen very carefully!
is it not enough that you would test the patience of humans?
will you now test the patience of my god?
but the lord will still show you this sign: the young woman is pregnant and will give birth to a son.
she will name him immanuel.
he will eat milk curds and honey as he learns to choose good and refuse evil.
but before he is old enough to make that choice, the land of the two kings you fear will be empty.
“but the lord will bring troubled times to you.
these troubles will be worse than anything that has happened since the time israel separated from judah.
this will happen to your people and to your father’s family when god brings the king of assyria to fight against you.
“at that time the lord will call for the ‘fly’ that is now near the streams of egypt, and he will call for the ‘bee’ that is now in the country of assyria.
those enemies will come to your country.
they will settle in the deep valleys and in the caves, by the thornbushes and watering holes.
the lord will use assyria to punish judah.
assyria will be hired and used like a razor to shave off judah’s beard and to remove the hair from his head and body.
“at that time someone might keep only one young cow and two sheep alive.
but there will be enough milk for them to eat milk curds.
in fact, everyone left in the country will eat milk curds and honey.
there are now fields that have 1000 grapevines, and each grapevine is worth 1000 pieces of silver.
but those fields will be covered with weeds and thorns.
that land will be wild and used only as a hunting ground where people go with bows and arrows.
people once worked the soil and grew food on these hills, but at that time they will not go there, because the fields will be covered with weeds and thorns.
it will be a place where cattle graze and sheep wander.” 
ezekiel.
chapter 42.
then the man led me through the north gate out into the outer courtyard.
he led me to a building with many rooms that was west of the restricted area and the building on the north side.
this building was 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide.
people entered it from the courtyard on the north side.
the building was three stories tall and had balconies.
the 20-cubit inner courtyard was between the building and the temple.
on the other side, the rooms faced the pavement of the outer courtyard.
there was a path 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long running along the south side of the building, even though the entrance was on the north side.
since this building was three stories tall and did not have columns like those columns of the outer courtyards, the top rooms were farther back than the rooms on the middle and bottom floors.
the top floor was narrower than the middle floor, which was narrower than the bottom floor because the balconies used this space.
there was a wall outside that was parallel to the rooms and ran along the outer courtyard.
it ran in front of the rooms for 50 cubits.
the row of rooms that ran along the outer courtyard was 50 cubits long, although the total length of the building, as on the temple side, was 100 cubits long.
the entrance was below these rooms at the east end of the building so that people could enter from the outer courtyard.
the entrance was at the start of the wall beside the courtyard.
there were rooms on the south side, by the restricted area and the other building.
these rooms had a 
path in front of them.
they were like the rooms on the north side.
they had the same length and width and the same kind of doors.
the entrance to the lower rooms was at the east end of the building so that people could enter from the open end of the path by the wall.
the man said to me, “the north rooms and south rooms across from the restricted area are holy.
these rooms are for the priests who offer the sacrifices to the lord.
that is where the priests will put the most holy offerings and eat them.
that is because that place is holy.
the most holy offerings are the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings.
the priests who enter the holy area must leave their serving clothes in that holy place before they go out into the outer courtyard, because these clothes are holy.
if a priest wants to go to the part of the temple where the other people are, he must go to those rooms and put on other clothes.” 
the man had finished measuring inside the temple area.
then he brought me out through the east gate and measured all around that area.
he measured the east side with the ruler.
it was 500 cubits long.
he measured the north side.
it was 500 cubits long.
he measured the south side.
it was 500 cubits long.
he went around to the west side and measured it.
it was 500 cubits long.
he measured the four walls that went all the way around the temple.
the wall was 500 cubits long and 500 cubits wide.
it separated the holy area from the area that is not holy.
chapter 94.
the lord is a god who punishes people.
god, come punish them.
you are the judge of the whole earth.
give proud people the punishment they deserve.
lord, how long will the wicked have their fun?
how much longer?
how much longer will those criminals brag about the evil they did?
lord, they hurt your people and make them suffer.
they kill widows and foreigners living in our country.
they murder orphans.
and they say the lord does not see them doing these evil things!
they say the god of jacob does not know what is happening.
you evil people are foolish.
when will you learn your lesson?
you are so stupid!
you must try to understand.
god made our ears, so surely he can hear what is happening!
he made our eyes, so surely he can see you!
the one who disciplines nations will surely correct you.
he is the one who teaches us everything.
the lord knows what people are thinking.
he knows that their thoughts are like a puff of wind.
lord, great blessings belong to those you discipline, to those you teach from your law.
you help them stay calm when trouble comes.
you will help them until the wicked are put in their graves.
the lord will not leave his people.
he will not leave them without help.
justice will return and bring fairness.
and those who want to do right will be there to see it.
no one helped me fight against the wicked.
no one stood with me against those who do evil.
and if the lord had not helped me, i would have been silenced by death.
i know i was ready to fall, but, lord, your faithful love supported me.
i was very worried and upset, but you comforted me and made me happy!
you don’t help crooked judges.
they use the law to make life hard for the people.
they attack those who do right.
they say innocent people are guilty and put them to death.
but the lord is my place of safety, high on the mountain.
god, my rock, is my safe place!
he will punish those evil judges for the bad things they did.
he will destroy them because they sinned.
the lord our god will destroy them.
chapter 4.
then moses said to god, “but the israelites will not believe me when i tell them that you sent me.
they will say, ‘the lord did not appear to you.’” 
but the lord said to moses, “what is that you have in your hand?” moses answered, “it is my walking stick.” 
then god said, “throw your walking stick on the ground.” so moses threw his walking stick on the ground, and it became a snake.
moses ran from it, 
but the lord said to him, “reach out and grab the snake by its tail.” when moses reached out and caught the snake’s tail, the snake became a walking stick again.
then god said, “use your stick in this way, and the people will believe that you saw the lord, the god of your ancestors, the god of abraham, the god of isaac, and the god of jacob.” 
then the lord said to moses, “i will give you another proof.
put your hand under your robe.” so moses opened his robe and put his hand inside.
then he brought his hand out of the robe and it was changed.
his hand was covered with spots that were white like snow.
then god said, “now put your hand into your robe again.” so moses put his hand into his robe again.
then he brought his hand out, and his hand was changed.
now his hand was good again, as it was before.
then god said, “if the people don’t believe you when you use your walking stick, then they will believe you when you show them this sign.
if they still refuse to believe after you show them both of these signs, then take some water from the nile river.
pour the water on the ground, and as soon as it touches the ground, it will become blood.” 
then moses said to the lord, “but, lord, i am telling you, i am not a good speaker.
i have never been able to speak well.
and that hasn’t changed since you started talking to me.
i am still not a good speaker.
you know that i speak slowly and don’t use the best words.” 
then the lord said to him, “who made a person’s mouth?
and who can make someone deaf or not able to speak?
who can make a person blind?
who can make a person able to see?
i am the one.
i am the lord.
so go.
i will be with you when you speak.
i will give you the words to say.” 
but moses said, “my lord, i beg you to send someone else, not me.” 
then the lord became angry with moses and said, “all right!
i’ll give you someone to help you.
aaron the levite is your brother, isn’t he?
he is a good speaker.
in fact, aaron is already coming to meet you, and he will be happy to see you.
i will tell you what to say.
then you will tell aaron, and i will help him say it well.
i will tell both of you what to do.
so aaron will speak for you.
like god, you will speak to him, and he will tell the people what you say.
so go and carry your walking stick with you.
use it and the other miracles to show the people that i am with you.” 
then moses went back to jethro, his father-in-law.
moses said to him, “please let me go back to egypt.
i want to see if my people are still alive.” jethro said to moses, “go in peace.” 
then, while moses was still in midian, the lord said to him, “it is safe for you to go back to egypt now.
the men who wanted to kill you are now dead.” 
so moses put his wife and children on the donkey and returned to egypt.
he carried his walking stick with him—the walking stick with the power of god.
while moses was traveling back to egypt, the lord spoke to him, “when you talk to pharaoh remember to show him all the miracles that i have given you the power to do.
but i will cause pharaoh to be very stubborn.
he will not let the people go.
then you should say to pharaoh, ‘this is what the lord says: israel is my firstborn son.
and i am telling you to let my son go and worship me.
if you refuse to let israel go, then i will kill your firstborn son.’” 
on the way to egypt, moses stopped at a place to spend the night.
the lord met moses at that place and tried to kill him.
but zipporah took a flint knife and circumcised her son.
she took the skin and touched his feet.
then she said to moses, “you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
zipporah said this because she had to circumcise her son.
so god let moses live.
the lord had spoken to aaron and told him, “go out into the desert and meet moses.” so aaron went and met moses at the mountain of god.
he saw moses and kissed him.
moses told aaron everything the lord had commanded him to say and all the miracles he must do to prove that god had sent him.
so moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the israelites.
then aaron spoke to the people and told them everything the lord had told moses.
then moses did the miracles for all the people to see, 
and they believed what they had heard.
then the israelites understood that the lord had seen their troubles and had come to help them.
so they bowed down and worshiped god.
1 samuel.
chapter 1.
there was a man named elkanah from the zuph family who lived in ramah in the hill country of ephraim.
elkanah was the son of jeroham, the son of elihu, the son of tohu, the son of zuph from the tribe of ephraim.
elkanah had two wives.
one wife was named hannah and the other wife was named peninnah.
peninnah had children, but hannah did not.
every year elkanah left his town of ramah and went up to shiloh.
he worshiped the lord all-powerful at shiloh and offered sacrifices to the lord there.
shiloh was where eli’s sons, hophni and phinehas, served as priests of the lord.
whenever elkanah offered his sacrifices, he always gave one share of the food to his wife peninnah and a share of the food to each of peninnah’s children.
elkanah always gave an equal share of the food to hannah.
he did this because he loved her very much, even though the lord had not let hannah have any children.
peninnah always upset hannah and made her feel bad because the lord had not made her able to have children.
this happened every year when their family went to the lord’s house at shiloh.
peninnah would upset hannah so much that she would begin to cry and would not eat anything.
one year when this happened, 
her husband elkanah said to her, “hannah, why are you crying?
why won’t you eat?
why are you so sad?
you have me.
isn’t that better than having even ten sons?” 
after eating and drinking, hannah quietly got up and went to pray to the lord.
eli the priest was sitting on a chair near the door of the lord’s holy building.
hannah was so sad that she cried the whole time she was praying to the lord.
she made a special promise to god and said, “lord all-powerful, you can see how sad i am.
remember me.
don’t forget me.
if you will give me a son, i will give him to you.
he will be yours his whole life, and as a nazirite, he will not drink wine or strong drink, and no one will ever cut his hair.” 
hannah prayed to the lord a long time.
eli was watching her mouth while she was praying.
hannah was praying in her heart.
her lips were moving, but since she did not say the words out loud, eli thought she was drunk.
he said to her, “you have had too much to drink.
it is time to put away the wine.” 
hannah answered, “sir, i have not drunk any wine or beer.
i am deeply troubled, and i was telling the lord about all my problems.
don’t think i am a bad woman.
i have been praying so long because i have so many troubles and am very sad.” 
eli answered, “go in peace.
may the god of israel give you what you asked for.” 
hannah said, “may you be happy with me.” then she left and ate something.
she was not sad anymore.
early the next morning elkanah’s family got up.
they worshiped the lord and then went back home to ramah.
elkanah had sexual relations with his wife hannah, and the lord remembered hannah.
by that time the following year, hannah had become pregnant and had a son.
she named him samuel.
she said, “his name is samuel because i asked the lord for him.” 
elkanah went to shiloh to offer the sacrifice for that year and the gift he had promised to the lord.
he took his family with him.
but hannah did not go.
she told elkanah, “when the boy is old enough to eat solid food, i will take him to shiloh.
then i will give him to the lord.
he will become a nazirite.
he will stay there at shiloh.” 
hannah’s husband elkanah said to her, “do what you think is best.
you may stay home until the boy is old enough to eat solid food.
may the lord do what you have said.” so hannah stayed at home to nurse her son until he was old enough to eat solid food.
when the boy was old enough to eat solid food, hannah took him to the lord’s house at shiloh.
she also took a bull that was three years old, 20 pounds of flour, and a bottle of wine.
they went before the lord.
elkanah killed the bull as a sacrifice to the lord as he usually did.
then hannah gave the boy to eli.
she said to him, “pardon me, sir.
i am the same woman who stood near you praying to the lord.
i promise that i am telling the truth.
i prayed for this child, and the lord answered my prayer.
he gave me this child.
and now i give this child to the lord.
he will serve the lord all his life.” then hannah left the boy there and worshiped the lord.
2 kings.
chapter 12.
joash began to rule during jehu’s seventh year as king of israel.
joash ruled 40 years in jerusalem.
his mother was named zibiah of beersheba.
for as long as he lived, joash did what the lord considered right.
he did what jehoiada the priest taught him.
but he did not destroy the high places.
the people still made sacrifices and burned incense at those places of worship.
joash said to the priests, “there is much money in the lord’s temple.
people have given things to the temple and have paid the temple tax when they were counted.
and they have given money simply because they wanted to.
you priests should take that money and repair the lord’s temple.
each priest should use the money he gets from the people he serves.
he should use that money to repair the damage to the temple.” 
in the 23rd year that joash was king, the priests still had not repaired the temple, 
so king joash called for jehoiada the priest and the other priests.
joash said to them, “why haven’t you repaired the temple?
stop taking money from the people you serve.
that money must be used to repair the temple.” 
the priests agreed to stop taking money from the people, but they also decided not to repair the temple.
so jehoiada the priest took a box and made a hole in the top of it.
then he put the box on the south side of the altar.
this box was by the door where people came into the lord’s temple.
some of the priests were there to guard this doorway.
they took the money that people brought for the lord’s temple and put it into this box.
whenever the king’s secretary and the high priest saw that the box was full, they counted all the money that had been given for the lord’s temple and put it in bags.
then they paid the men who were in charge of the work on the lord’s temple.
they paid the carpenters and other builders who worked on the lord’s temple.
they used that money to pay the stoneworkers and stonecutters, and they used it to buy timber, cut stone, and everything else to repair the lord’s temple.
people gave money for the lord’s temple, but the priests could not use this money to make silver cups, snuffers, basins, trumpets, or any of the gold and silver dishes that were to be used inside the lord’s temple.
this money was used only to pay the workers who repaired the lord’s temple.
those who were in charge of paying the workers did not have to give a report of how they spent the money, because they could be trusted.
people gave money when they offered guilt offerings and sin offerings, but that money was not used for the lord’s temple.
it belonged to the priests.
hazael was the king of aram.
he went to fight against the city of gath and defeated it.
then he made plans to go fight against jerusalem.
joash and his ancestors—jehoshaphat, jehoram, and ahaziah—had all been kings of judah.
they had given many things to the lord that were kept in his temple.
joash gathered all these things and all the gold that was stored in the temple and in his palace.
he sent all this treasure to king hazael of aram, who then commanded his army to leave jerusalem.
all the great things that joash did are written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
joash’s officers made plans against him.
they killed joash at the house of millo on the road that goes down to silla.
jozabad son of shimeath and jehozabad son of shomer were joash’s officers.
these men killed joash.
the people buried joash with his ancestors in the city of david.
his son amaziah became the new king after him.
chapter 15.
this is a message about moab: one night armies took the wealth from ar in moab, and the city was destroyed.
one night armies took the wealth from kir in moab, and the city was destroyed.
the king’s family and the people of dibon go to the places of worship to cry.
the people of moab are crying for nebo and medeba.
they have shaved their heads and beards to show their sadness.
everywhere in moab, on the housetops and in the streets, people are wearing sackcloth.
everyone is crying.
in heshbon and elealeh they are crying loudly.
you can hear their voices as far away as jahaz.
even the soldiers are frightened.
they are shaking with fear.
my heart cries, full of sorrow for moab.
its people run away to zoar for safety.
they run to eglath shelishiyah.
the people are crying as they go up the road to luhith.
they are crying loudly as they walk on the road to horonaim.
but nimrim brook is as dry as a desert.
the grass has dried up, and the plants are all dead.
nothing is green.
so the people gather up everything they own and cross the border at arabah stream.
you can hear crying everywhere in moab— as far away as eglaim and beer elim.
the water of dimon is full of blood, and i will bring even more troubles to dimon.
a few people living in moab have escaped the enemy, but i will send lions to eat them.
chapter 45.
this is what the lord said to cyrus, his chosen king: “i took you by your right hand to help you defeat nations, to strip other kings of their power, and to open city gates that will not be closed again.
i will go in front of you and make the mountains flat.
i will break the city gates of bronze and cut the iron bars on the gates.
i will give you the wealth that is stored in secret places.
i will give you those hidden treasures.
then you will know that i am the lord, the god of israel, who calls you by name.
i do this for my servant, jacob.
i do it for my chosen people, israel.
cyrus, i am calling you by name.
you don’t know me, but i know you.
i am the lord, the only god.
there is no other god except me.
i put your clothes on you, but still you don’t know me.
i am doing this so that everyone will know that i am the only god.
from the east to the west, people will know that i am the lord and that there is no other god.
i made the light and the darkness.
i bring peace, and i cause trouble.
i, the lord, do all these things.
“may the clouds in the skies above pour goodness on the earth like rain.
may the earth open up to let salvation grow.
and may goodness grow with that salvation, which i, the lord, created.
“look at these people!
they are arguing with the one who made them.
look at them argue with me.
they are like pieces of clay from a broken pot.
clay does not say to the one molding it, ‘man, what are you doing?’ things that are made don’t have the power to question the one who makes them.
a father gives life to his children, and they cannot ask, ‘why are you giving me life?’ they cannot question their mother and ask, ‘why are you giving birth to me?’” 
the lord god is the holy one of israel.
he created israel, and he says, “my children, you asked me to show you a sign.
you told me to show you what i have done.
i made the earth, and i created the people on it.
i used my own hands to make the skies.
and i command all the armies in the sky.
i was right to give power to cyrus, and i will make his work easy.
he will rebuild my city, and he will set my people free without bribes or payment.” the lord all-powerful said this.
the lord says, “egypt and ethiopia are rich, but, israel, you will get those riches.
the tall people from seba will be yours.
they will walk behind you with chains around their necks.
they will bow down before you and ask you to pray for them and say, ‘the true god really is with you, and there is no other god.’” 
you are the god people cannot see.
you are the god who saves israel.
many people make false gods, but they will be disappointed.
all of them will go away ashamed.
but israel will be saved by the lord.
that salvation will continue forever.
never again will israel be shamed.
the lord is god.
he made the skies and the earth.
he put the earth in its place.
he did not want the earth to be empty when he made it.
he created it to be lived on.
“i am the lord.
there is no other god.
i have spoken openly, not in secret.
i did not hide my words in a dark and secret place.
i did not tell the people of jacob to look for me in empty places.
i am the lord, and i speak the truth.
i say only what is right.
“you people who escaped from other nations, gather together before me.
(these people carry statues of false gods.
they pray to useless gods, but they don’t know what they are doing.
tell them to come to me.
let them present their case and discuss these things.)
“who told you about this before it happened?
who told you this so long ago?
i, the lord, am the one who said these things.
i am the only god, the one who does what is right.
i am the one who saves, and there is no other!
so all you people in faraway places, turn to me and be saved, because i am god, and there is no other.
“when i make a promise, that promise is true.
it will happen.
and i swear by my own power that everyone will bow before me and will take an oath to obey me.
they will say, ‘goodness and strength come only from the lord.’” and all who show their anger against him will be humiliated.
the lord will help the people of israel live right and praise their god.
chapter 38.
a song of david for the day of remembrance.
lord, don’t criticize me when you are angry.
don’t discipline me in anger.
you have hurt me.
you punished me and hurt me deeply.
you punished me severely, so my whole body is sore.
i sinned, and now all my bones hurt.
my guilt is like a heavy burden.
i am sinking beneath its weight.
i did a foolish thing, and now i have infected sores that stink.
i am bent and bowed down.
i am depressed all day long.
i am burning with fever, and my whole body hurts.
i hurt so much i cannot feel anything.
my pounding heart makes me scream!
my lord, you heard my groaning.
you can hear my sighs.
my heart is pounding.
my strength is gone, and i am going blind.
because of my sickness, my friends and neighbors will not visit me; my family will not come near me.
my enemies say bad things about me.
they are spreading lies and rumors.
they talk about me all the time.
but i am like a deaf man and cannot hear.
i am like someone who cannot speak.
i am like those who cannot hear what people are saying about them.
i cannot answer to prove my enemies wrong.
lord, you must defend me.
lord my god, you must speak for me.
that’s why i prayed, “don’t let my enemies smile at my pain.
full of pride, they will laugh if i stumble and fall.” 
i know i am guilty of doing wrong.
i cannot forget my pain.
lord, i told you about the evil i have done.
i am sorry for my sin.
but my enemies are alive and healthy, and they have told many lies.
i did nothing but good, and they paid me back with evil.
i try to do what is right, but that only makes them turn against me.
lord, don’t leave me.
my god, stay close to me.
come quickly and help me.
my lord, you are the one who saves me.
chapter 11.
the lord hates false scales, but he loves accurate weights.
proud and boastful people will be shamed, but wisdom stays with those who are modest and humble.
good people are guided by their honesty, but crooks who lie and cheat will ruin themselves.
money is worthless when you face god’s punishment, but living right will save you from death.
doing right makes life better for those who are good, but the wicked are destroyed by their own wicked ways.
doing right sets honest people free, but people who can’t be trusted are trapped by their greed.
when the wicked die, all their hopes are lost; everything they thought they could do comes to nothing.
good people escape from trouble, but the wicked come along and are trapped by it.
with their words hypocrites can destroy their neighbors.
but with what they know, good people can escape.
when good people are successful, the whole city is happy, and they all shout with joy when evil people are destroyed.
blessings from the honest people living in a city will make it great, but the things evil people say can destroy it.
stupid people say bad things about their neighbors.
wise people know to be quiet.
people who tell secrets about others cannot be trusted.
those who can be trusted keep quiet.
a nation without wise leaders will fall.
many good advisors make a nation safe.
you will be sorry if you promise to pay a stranger’s debt.
refuse to make such promises and you will be safe.
a kind and gentle woman gains respect, but violent men gain only wealth.
people who are kind will be rewarded for their kindness, but cruel people will be rewarded with trouble.
the work of evil people is all lies, but those who do right will receive a good reward.
people who do what is right are on their way to life, but those who always want to do wrong are on their way to death.
the lord hates those who love to do evil, but he is pleased with those who try to do right.
the truth is, evil people will be punished, and good people will be set free.
a beautiful woman without good sense is like a gold ring in a pig’s nose.
what good people want brings more good.
what evil people want brings more trouble.
some people give freely and gain more; others refuse to give and end up with less.
give freely, and you will profit.
help others, and you will gain more for yourself.
people curse a greedy man who refuses to sell his grain, but they bless a man who sells his grain to feed others.
people are pleased with those who try to do good.
those who look for trouble will find it.
those who trust in their riches will fall like dead leaves, but good people will blossom.
those who cause trouble for their families will inherit nothing but the wind.
a foolish person will end up as a servant to one who is wise.
what good people produce is like a life-giving tree.
those who are wise give new life to others.
if good people are rewarded here on earth, then surely those who do evil will also get what they deserve.
chapter 28.
“there are mines where people get silver and places where people melt gold to make it pure.
iron is dug out of the ground, and copper is melted out of the rocks.
miners carry lights deep into caves to search for these rocks in the deepest darkness.
far from where people live, they dig deep into the ground, down where no one else has been before.
there they work all alone, hanging from ropes.
food grows on the ground above.
but underground it is different, as if everything were melted by fire.
in the rocks there are sapphires and grains of pure gold.
wild birds know nothing about the way to these places.
no falcon has ever seen it.
wild animals have never been there.
lions have not traveled that way.
miners dig the hardest rocks.
they dig away at the mountains and make them bare.
they cut tunnels through the rocks and see all the treasures they hold.
they even find places where rivers begin.
they bring to light what once was hidden.
“but where can anyone find wisdom?
where can we get understanding?
people don’t know where wisdom is.
it cannot be found by anyone on earth.
the deep ocean says, ‘it’s not here with me.’ the sea says, ‘it’s not here with me.’ 
you cannot buy wisdom with even the purest gold.
there’s not enough silver in the world to pay for it.
you cannot buy it with gold from ophir or with precious onyx or sapphires.
wisdom is worth more than gold or crystal.
it cannot be bought with expensive jewels set in gold.
it is far more valuable than coral and jasper, more precious than rubies.
the topaz from ethiopia cannot match its value, which is greater than the purest gold.
“so where does wisdom come from?
where can we find understanding?
wisdom is hidden from every living thing on earth.
even birds in the sky cannot see it.
death and destruction say, ‘we have never seen wisdom; we have only heard rumors about it.’ 
“only god knows the way to wisdom.
only he knows where wisdom is.
he can see to the very ends of the earth.
he sees everything under the sky.
god gave the wind its power.
he decided how big to make the oceans.
he decided where to send the rain and where the thunderstorms should go.
he looked at wisdom and discussed it.
he examined it and saw how much it is worth.
then he said to humans, ‘to fear and respect the lord is wisdom.
to turn away from evil is understanding.’” 
nahum.
chapter 3.
it will be very bad for that city of murderers.
nineveh is a city full of lies.
it is filled with things taken from other countries.
it is filled with plenty of people that it hunted and killed.
you can hear the sounds of whips and the noise of wheels.
you can hear horses galloping and chariots bouncing along!
soldiers on horses are attacking, their swords are shining, their spears are gleaming!
there are many dead people.
dead bodies are piled up—too many bodies to count.
people are tripping over the dead bodies.
all this happened because of nineveh.
nineveh is like a prostitute who could never get enough.
she wanted more and more.
she sold herself to many nations, and she used her magic to make them her slaves.
the lord all-powerful says, “i am against you, nineveh.
i will pull your dress up over your face.
i will let the nations see your naked body.
the kingdoms will see your shame.
i will throw dirty things on you and treat you in a hateful way.
people will look at you and laugh.
everyone who sees you will be shocked.
they will say, ‘nineveh is destroyed.
who will cry for her?’ i know i cannot find anyone to comfort you, nineveh.” 
nineveh, are you better than thebes on the nile river?
thebes also had water all around her to protect herself from enemies.
she used that water like a wall too.
ethiopia and egypt made thebes strong.
libya and the sudan supported her, 
but thebes was defeated.
her people were taken away as prisoners to a foreign country.
soldiers beat her small children to death at every street corner.
they threw lots to see who got to keep the important people as slaves.
they put chains on all the important men of thebes.
so, nineveh, you will also fall like a drunk.
you will try to hide.
you will look for a safe place away from the enemy.
but nineveh, all your strong places will be like fig trees.
when new figs become ripe, people come and shake the tree.
the figs fall into their mouths.
they eat them, and the figs are gone.
nineveh, your people are all like women—and the enemy soldiers are ready to take them.
the gates of your land are open wide for your enemies to come in.
fire has destroyed the wooden bars across the gates.
get water and store it inside your city, because the enemy soldiers will surround your city.
make your defenses strong!
get clay to make more bricks and mix the mortar.
get the molds for making bricks.
you can do all these things, but the fire will still destroy you completely.
and the sword will kill you.
your land will look like a swarm of grasshoppers came and ate everything.
nineveh, you grew and grew.
you became like a swarm of grasshoppers.
you were like a swarm of locusts.
you have many traders who go places and buy things.
they are as many as the stars in the sky.
they are like locusts that come and eat until everything is gone and then leave.
and your government officials are also like locusts that settle on a stone wall on a cold day.
but when the sun comes up, the rocks become warm, and the locusts all fly away.
and no one knows where.
king of assyria, your shepherds fell asleep.
these powerful men are sleeping.
and now your sheep have wandered away on the mountains.
there is no one to bring them back.
nineveh, you have been hurt badly, and nothing can heal your wound.
everyone who hears the news of your destruction claps their hands.
they are all happy, because they all felt the pain you caused again and again.
chapter 2.
an enemy is coming to attack you, so guard the strong places of your city.
watch the road.
get ready for war.
prepare for battle!
yes, the lord changed jacob’s pride.
he made it like israel’s pride.
the enemy destroyed them and ruined their grapevines.
the shields of his soldiers are red.
their uniforms are bright red.
their chariots are shining like flames of fire and are lined up for battle.
their horses are ready to go.
the chariots race wildly through the streets and rush back and forth through the square.
they look like burning torches, like lightning flashing from place to place!
the enemy calls for his best soldiers.
they stumble as they rush ahead.
they run to the wall and set up their shield over the battering ram.
but the gates by the rivers are open, and the enemy comes flooding in and destroys the king’s palace.
the enemy takes away the queen, and her slave girls moan sadly like doves.
they beat their breasts to show their sadness.
nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away.
people yell, “stop!
stop running away!” but it does not do any good.
take the silver!
take the gold!
there are many things to take.
there are many treasures.
now nineveh is empty.
everything is stolen.
the city is ruined.
people have lost their courage, their hearts melt with fear, their knees knock together, their bodies shake, and their faces turn pale.
where is that great city now?
it was like a den where the lions feed their young.
it was a place where people felt safe, like lions in a cave with no one there to harm them.
the lion was able to catch plenty of food to feed his cubs and his mate.
he filled his cave with the animals he killed.
he filled his den with the meat he gathered.
the lord all-powerful says, “i am against you, nineveh.
i will burn your chariots and kill your ‘young lions’ in battle.
you will not hunt anyone on earth again.
people will never again hear bad news from your messengers.” 
2 samuel.
chapter 22.
david sang this song to the lord when the lord saved him from saul and all his other enemies.
the lord is my rock, my fortress, my place of safety.
he is my god, the rock i run to for protection.
he is my shield; by his power i am saved.
he is my hiding place, my place of safety, high in the hills.
he is my savior, the one who rescues me from the cruel enemy.
i called to the lord for help, and he saved me from my enemies.
he is worth of my praise!
waves of death were crashing around me.
a deadly flood was carrying me away.
the ropes of the grave wrapped around me.
death set its trap right there in front of me.
in my trouble i called to the lord.
yes, i cried out to my god for help.
there in his temple he heard my voice.
he heard my cry for help.
the earth shook and shivered.
the foundations of heaven trembled.
they shook because he was angry!
smoke came from his nose.
burning flames came from his mouth.
red-hot coals fell from him.
he tore open the sky and came down.
he stood on a thick, dark cloud.
he flew across the sky, riding on a cherub angel, gliding on the wings of the wind.
he wrapped himself in darkness that covered him like a tent.
he was hidden by dark clouds filled with water.
out of the brightness before him, flashes of lightning came down.
the lord thundered from the sky.
god most high let his voice be heard.
he scattered the enemy with his arrows— the lightning bolts that threw them into confusion.
the lord shouted his command, and a powerful wind began to blow.
then the bottom of the sea could be seen, and the earth’s foundations were uncovered.
the lord reached down from above and grabbed me.
he pulled me from the deep water.
he saved me from my powerful enemies, who hated me.
they were too strong for me, so he saved me.
they attacked me in my time of trouble, but the lord was there to support me.
he was pleased with me, so he rescued me.
he took me to a safe place.
the lord rewarded me for doing what is right.
he was good to me because i am innocent.
the lord did this because i have obeyed him.
i have not turned against my god.
i always remembered his laws.
i never stopped following his rules.
he knows i did nothing that was wrong.
i have kept myself from sinning.
so the lord rewarded me for doing what is right.
he could see that i am innocent.
lord, you are faithful to those who are faithful.
you are good to those who are good.
you never do wrong to those who have done no wrong.
but you outsmart the wicked, no matter how clever they are.
you help those who are humble, but as soon as you see the proud, you humiliate them.
lord, you are my lamp.
you, lord, turn the darkness around me into light.
with your help i can defeat an army.
if my god is with me, i can climb over enemy walls.
god’s way is perfect.
the lord’s promise always proves to be true.
he protects those who trust in him.
there is no god except the lord.
there is no rock except our god.
god is my strong fortress.
he clears the path i need to take.
he makes my feet as steady as those of a deer.
even on steep mountains he keeps me from falling.
he trains me for war so that my arms can bend the most powerful bow.
lord, you have given me your shield to protect me.
it is your help that has made me great.
you cleared a path for my feet so that i could walk without stumbling.
i chased my enemies and defeated them.
i did not stop until they were destroyed.
i destroyed my enemies.
i struck them down.
they did not get up again.
they fell under my feet.
lord, you made me strong in battle.
you made my enemies fall before me.
you made my enemies turn and run away.
i destroyed those who hated me.
they looked for help, but there was no one to save them.
they cried out to the lord, but he did not answer them.
i beat my enemies to pieces like dust on the ground.
i smashed them and walked on them like mud in the streets.
you saved me from those who fought against me.
you made me the ruler over nations.
people i never knew now serve me.
foreigners fall helpless before me!
as soon as they heard about me, they were ready to obey.
they lose all their courage and come out of their hiding places shaking with fear.
the lord lives!
i praise my rock!
how great is my god, the rock who saves me!
he is the god who punishes my enemies for me, the one who puts people under my rule.
he saves me from my enemies!
you help me defeat those who attack me.
you save me from cruel people.
lord, that is why i praise you among the nations.
that is why i sing songs of praise to your name.
you help your king win battle after battle.
you show your faithful love to your chosen one, to david and his descendants forever!
chapter 65.
“i helped people who had not come to me for advice.
those who found me were not looking for me.
i spoke to a nation that does not use my name.
i said, ‘here i am!
here i am!’ 
“all day long i stood ready to accept those who turned against me.
but they kept doing whatever they wanted to do, and all they did was wrong.
they keep doing things, right in front of me, that make me angry.
they offer sacrifices and burn incense in their special gardens.
they sit among the graves, waiting to get messages from the dead.
they eat the meat of pigs, and their pots are full of soup made from unclean meat.
but they tell others, ‘don’t come near me!
don’t touch me because i am holy!’ they are like smoke in my eyes, and their fire burns all the time.” 
“look, here is a letter that lists all your sins.
i will not be quiet until i pay you back for these sins.
i will do it by punishing you.
i, the lord, am doing this because of your sins and the sins of your ancestors.
they did these sins when they burned incense in the mountains.
they shamed me on those hills, and i punished them first.” 
the lord says, “when there is new wine in the grapes, people squeeze out the wine.
but they don’t completely destroy the grapes because the grapes can still be used.
i will do the same thing to my servants.
i will not destroy them completely.
i will keep some of the people of jacob.
some of the people of judah will get my mountains.
i will choose the people who will get the land.
my servants will live there.
then sharon valley will be a field for sheep.
the valley of achor will be a place for cattle to rest.
all this will be for my people—for the people who come to me for help.
“but you people left the lord, so you will be punished.
you forgot about my holy mountain.
you began to worship luck.
you held feasts for the false god, fate.
but i decided what would happen to you: you will be killed with a sword.
you will all be killed because i called to you, but you refused to answer me.
i spoke to you, but you would not listen.
you did what i said is evil and chose to do what i did not like.” 
so this is what the lord god says: “my servants will eat, but you evil people will be hungry.
my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty.
my servants will be happy, but you will suffer shame.
my servants will shout for joy, but you will cry out in pain.
your spirits will be broken, and you will be very sad.
your names will be like curses to my chosen servants.” the lord god will kill you, and then he will call his servants by a new name.
the lord says, “people now ask blessings from the earth.
but in the future they will ask blessings from the faithful god.
people now trust in the power of the earth when they make a promise.
but in the future they will trust in the god who is faithful.
that’s because the troubles in the past will all be forgotten.
they will be hidden from my sight.” 
“i am creating a new heaven and a new earth.
the troubles of the past will be forgotten.
no one will remember them.
my people will be happy and rejoice forever and ever because of what i will make.
i will make a jerusalem that is full of joy, and i will make her people happy.
“then i will rejoice with jerusalem.
i will be happy with my people.
there will never again be crying and sadness in that city.
in that city there will never be a baby who lives only a few days, and every older person will live for a long, long time.
a person who lives 100 years will be called young.
and whoever doesn’t live that long will be considered cursed.
“in that city whoever builds a house will live there; whoever plants a vineyard will eat the grapes from that garden.
never again will one person build a house and another person live there.
never again will one person plant a garden and another eat the fruit from it.
my people will live as long as the trees.
my chosen people will get full use of whatever they make.
never again will a woman suffer childbirth and have her baby die.
women will not fear childbirth.
i, the lord, will bless all my people and their children.
i will answer them before they call for help.
i will help them before they finish asking.
wolves and little lambs will eat together.
lions will eat hay like cattle, and snakes will eat only dust.
they will not hurt or destroy each other on my holy mountain.” this is what the lord said.
chapter 23.
a song of david.
the lord is my shepherd.
i will always have everything i need.
he gives me green pastures to lie in.
he leads me by calm pools of water.
he restores my strength.
he leads me on right paths to show that he is good.
even if i walk through a valley as dark as the grave, i will not be afraid of any danger, because you are with me.
your rod and staff comfort me.
you prepared a meal for me in front of my enemies.
you welcomed me as an honored guest.
my cup is full and spilling over.
your goodness and mercy will be with me all my life, and i will live in the lord’s house a long, long time.
chapter 2.
“then we did what the lord told me to do.
we went back into the desert on the road that leads to the red sea.
we traveled for many days to go around the mountains of seir.
then the lord said to me, 
‘you have traveled around these mountains long enough.
turn north.
tell the people this: you will pass through the land of seir.
this land belongs to your relatives, the descendants of esau.
they will be afraid of you.
be very careful.
don’t fight them.
i will not give you any of their land—not even a foot of it, because i gave the hill country of seir to esau to keep as his own.
you must pay the people of esau for any food you eat or water you drink there.
remember that the lord your god has blessed you in everything you have done.
he knows about everything that happened on the trip through this great desert.
the lord your god has been with you these 40 years.
you have always had everything you needed.’ 
“so we passed by our relatives, the people of esau living there in seir.
we left the road that leads from the jordan valley to the towns of elath and ezion geber.
we turned onto the road that goes to the desert in moab.
“the lord said to me, ‘don’t bother the moabites.
don’t start a war against them.
i will not give you any of their land.
they are the descendants of lot, and i gave them the city of ar.’” 
(in the past, the emites lived in ar.
they were strong people, and there were many of them.
they were very tall, like the anakites.
the anakites were part of the rephaites.
people thought the emites were also rephaites, but the people of moab called them emites.
the horites also lived in seir in the past.
then esau’s people destroyed the horites, took their land, and settled there, just as the israelites did to the people in the land that the lord gave them.)
“the lord told me, ‘now, go to the other side of zered valley.’ so we crossed zered valley.
it was 38 years from the time we left kadesh barnea until the time we crossed zered valley.
as the lord had promised, all the fighting men in our camp from that generation had died.
the lord had opposed those men until they were all dead and gone from our camp.
“after all the fighting men were dead and gone, 
the lord said to me, 
‘today you must cross the border at ar and go into moab.
you will be just across from the ammonites.
don’t bother them or fight with them, because i will not give you their land.
they are descendants of lot, and i have given that land to them.’” 
(that country is also known as the land of rephaim.
the rephaites lived there in the past.
the people of ammon called them the zamzummites.
there were many rephaites, and they were very strong and tall like the anakites.
but the lord helped the ammonites destroy them.
the ammonites took that land and live there now.
god did the same thing for esau’s people.
in the past the horites lived in seir.
but esau’s people destroyed the horites, and esau’s descendants still live there today.
god did the same thing for some people from crete.
the avvites lived in the towns around gaza, but the cretans destroyed them, took the land, and live there now.)
“the lord told me, ‘get ready to go across arnon valley.
i will let you defeat sihon the amorite, the king of heshbon.
i will let you take his country.
so fight against him and take his land.
today i will make all people everywhere afraid of you.
they will hear the news about you, and they will be afraid and shake with fear.’ 
“while we were in the desert of kedemoth, i sent messengers to king sihon of heshbon.
the messengers offered peace to sihon.
they said, 
‘let us go through your land.
we will stay on the road.
we will not turn off the road to the right or to the left.
we will pay you in silver for any food we eat or any water we drink.
we only want to march through your country.
let us go through your land until we go across the jordan river into the land that the lord our god is giving us.
other people have let us go through their land—the people of esau living in seir and the moabites living in ar.’ 
“but king sihon of heshbon would not let us pass through his country.
the lord your god had made him very stubborn and ready to fight.
the lord did this so that he could help you defeat king sihon.
and today we know that is what happened.
“the lord said to me, ‘i am giving king sihon and his country to you.
now, go take his land!’ 
“then king sihon and all his people came out to fight against us at jahaz.
but the lord our god gave him to us.
we defeated king sihon, his sons, and all his people.
we captured all the cities that belonged to king sihon at that time.
we completely destroyed the people in every city—the men, women, and children.
we did not leave anyone alive!
we took only the cattle and the valuable things from those cities.
we defeated the town of aroer on the edge of the arnon valley and the other town in the middle of that valley.
the lord let us defeat all the cities between the arnon valley and gilead.
no city was too strong for us.
but you did not go near the land that belongs to the people of ammon.
you did not go near the shores of the jabbok river or the cities of the hill country.
you did not go near any place that the lord our god would not let us have.
chapter 8.
“put the trumpet to your lips and give the warning.
be like an eagle over the lord’s house.
the israelites have broken my agreement.
they have not obeyed my law.
they yell out at me, ‘my god, we in israel know you!’ 
but israel refused the good things, so the enemy chases him.
the israelites chose their kings, but they didn’t come to me for advice.
they chose leaders, but they didn’t choose men i knew.
the israelites used their silver and gold to make idols for themselves, so they will be destroyed.
he has refused your calf, samaria.
god says, ‘i am very angry with the israelites.’ the people of israel will be punished for their sin.
some worker made those statues.
they are not god.
samaria’s calf will be broken into pieces.
the israelites did a foolish thing—it was like trying to plant the wind.
but they will get only troubles—they will harvest a whirlwind.
the grain in the fields will grow, but it will give no food.
even if it grew something, strangers would eat it.
“israel was destroyed; its people are scattered among the nations, like some dish that was thrown away because no one wanted it.
ephraim went to his ‘lovers.’ like a stubborn donkey, they led him off to assyria.
yes, israel was taken to the nations, but i will bring them back.
but first, they must suffer a little by carrying the burden of that mighty king.
“ephraim built more and more altars, and that was a sin.
they have been altars of sin for ephraim.
even if i wrote 10,000 laws for ephraim, he would treat them as if they were for some stranger.
the israelites love sacrifices.
they offer the meat and eat it.
the lord does not accept their sacrifices.
he remembers their sins, and he will punish them.
they will be carried away as prisoners to egypt.
israel has built palaces for their kings, and now judah builds fortresses.
but they have forgotten their maker!
so i will send a fire to destroy their cities and fortresses!” 
zechariah.
chapter 2.
then i looked up and saw a man holding a rope for measuring things.
i asked him, “where are you going?” he said to me, “i am going to measure jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is.” 
then the angel who was speaking to me left, and another angel went out to talk to him.
he said to him, “run and tell that young man this: ‘jerusalem will be a city without walls, because there will be too many people and animals living there.’ 
the lord says, ‘i will be a wall of fire around her, to protect her, and to bring glory to that city, i will live there.’” the lord says, 
“hurry!
leave the land in the north in a hurry.
yes, it is true that i scattered your people in every direction.
you people from zion now live in babylon.
run away from that city!” 
the lord sent me to the nations that took away your wealth.
he sent me to bring you honor.
and this is what the lord all-powerful said: “if anyone even touches you, it is as if they did it to the pupil of my eye.
watch and see how i will punish them: their own slaves will become their masters and take all their wealth.” then you will know it was the lord all-powerful who sent me to tell you these things.
the lord says, “zion, be happy, because i am coming, and i will live in your city.
at that time people from many nations will come to me.
they will become my people, and i will live in your city.” then you will know it was the lord all-powerful who sent me to tell you these things.
the lord will again choose jerusalem to be his special city.
judah will be his share of the holy land.
everyone, be quiet!
the lord is coming out of his holy house.
chapter 20.
then zophar from naamah answered: 
“you upset me, so i must answer you.
i must tell you what i am thinking.
you insulted me with your answers!
but i am wise and know how to answer you.
“you know that the joy of the wicked does not last long.
that has been true a long time, ever since adam was put on earth.
those who don’t know god are happy for only a short time.
maybe an evil man’s pride will reach up to the sky, and his head will touch the clouds.
but he will be gone forever like his own body waste.
people who knew him will say, ‘where is he?’ 
like a dream, he will fly away, never to be found.
he will be chased away like a bad dream.
those who knew him before will not see him again.
his family will never again get to see him.
his children will have to give back what he took from the poor.
his own hands will give up his wealth.
when he was young, his bones were strong, but, like the rest of his body, they will soon lie in the dirt.
“evil tastes sweet in his mouth.
he keeps it under his tongue to enjoy it fully.
he hates to let it go and holds it in his mouth.
but that evil will turn sour in his stomach.
it will be like a snake’s bitter poison inside him.
the evil man will spit out the riches he has swallowed.
god will make him vomit them up.
what he drank will be like a snake’s poison; it will kill him like the bite of a deadly snake.
he will never again enjoy so much wealth— rivers flowing with honey and cream.
he will be forced to give back his profits.
he will not be allowed to enjoy what he worked for, 
because he hurt the poor and left them with nothing.
he took houses he did not build.
“the evil man is never satisfied.
but the things he wants cannot save him.
after filling himself, there is nothing left.
his success will not continue.
even while he has plenty, he will be pressed down with trouble.
his problems will come down on him!
if he does get all he wants, god will throw his burning anger against him.
god will attack him and rain down punishment on him.
maybe he will run away from an iron sword, but then a bronze arrow will strike him down.
it will go through his body and stick out of his back.
its shining point will pierce his liver, and he will be shocked with terror.
all his treasures will be lost in darkness.
he will be destroyed by a fire, a fire that no human started.
it will destroy everything left in his house.
heaven will prove that he is guilty.
the earth will be a witness against him.
his house and everything in it will be carried away in the flood of god’s anger.
that is what god will do to those who are evil.
that is what he plans to give them.” 
1 samuel.
chapter 11.
about a month later, nahash the ammonite and his army surrounded jabesh gilead.
all the people of jabesh said to nahash, “if you will make a treaty with us, we will serve you.” 
but he answered, “i will make a treaty with you people only if i can poke out the right eye of each person.
then all israel will be ashamed.” 
the leaders of jabesh said to nahash, “let us have seven days.
we will send messengers through all israel.
if no one comes to help us, we will come up to you and surrender to you.” 
the messengers came to gibeah where saul lived.
they told the news to the people.
the people cried loudly.
saul had been out in the field with his oxen.
when he came in from the field he heard the people crying and asked, “what’s wrong with the people?
why are they crying?” then the people told saul what the messengers from jabesh said.
saul listened to their story.
then god’s spirit came on him with great power.
saul became very angry.
he took a pair of oxen and cut them in pieces.
then he gave the pieces of the oxen to messengers.
he ordered the messengers to carry the pieces throughout the land of israel.
he told them to give this message to the israelites: “come follow saul and samuel.
if anyone doesn’t come and help them, this same thing will happen to his oxen.” a great fear from the lord came on the people.
they all came together like one person.
saul gathered the men together at bezek.
there were 300,000 men from israel and 30,000 men from judah.
saul and his army told the messengers from jabesh, “tell the people at jabesh in gilead that by noon tomorrow, you will be saved.” the messengers told saul’s message to the people at jabesh, and they were very happy.
then the people of jabesh said to nahash the ammonite, “tomorrow we will come to you, and you can do whatever you want to us.” 
the next morning saul separated his soldiers into three groups.
at sunrise, saul and his soldiers entered the ammonite camp.
saul attacked while they were changing guards that morning.
he and his soldiers defeated the ammonites before noon.
the ammonite soldiers all ran away in different directions—no two soldiers stayed together.
then the people said to samuel, “where are the people who said they didn’t want saul to rule as king?
bring them here, and we will kill them.” 
but saul said, “no, don’t kill anyone today!
the lord saved israel today.” 
then samuel said to the people, “come, let’s go to gilgal.
at gilgal we will again make saul the king.” 
all the people went to gilgal.
there, in front of the lord, the people made saul king.
they offered fellowship offerings to the lord.
saul and all the israelites had a great celebration.
chapter 40.
your god says, “comfort, comfort my people.
speak kindly to jerusalem and tell her, ‘your time of service is finished.
you have paid the price for your sins.’ i, the lord, have punished you twice for every sin you committed.” 
listen, there is someone shouting: “prepare a way in the desert for the lord.
make a straight road there for our god.
every valley must be filled.
every mountain and hill should be made flat.
the crooked roads should be made straight, and the rough ground made smooth.
then the glory of the lord will be shown to everyone.
together, all people will see it.
yes, this is what the lord himself said!” 
a voice said, “speak!” so the man said, “what should i say?” the voice said, “people are like grass.
any glory they enjoy is like a wildflower.
when a wind from the lord blows on them, the grass dies and the flower falls.
yes, all people are like grass.
grass dies and flowers fall, but the word of our god lasts forever.” 
zion, you have good news to tell.
go up on a high mountain and shout the good news.
jerusalem, you have good news to tell.
don’t be afraid; speak loudly.
tell this news to all the cities of judah: “look, here is your god!” 
the lord god is coming with power.
he will use his power to rule all the people.
he will bring rewards for his people.
he will have their payment with him.
like a good shepherd, he takes care of his people.
he gathers them like lambs in his arms.
he holds them close, while their mothers walk beside him.
who measured the oceans in the palm of his hand?
who used his hand to measure the sky?
who used a bowl to measure all the dust of the earth?
who used scales to measure the mountains and hills?
who could know the lord’s mind?
who could be his teacher or give him advice?
did the lord ask for anyone’s help?
did anyone teach him to be fair?
did anyone teach him knowledge?
did anyone teach him to be wise?
look, all the nations in the world are like one small drop in the bucket.
if the lord took all the faraway nations and put them on his scales, they would be like small pieces of dust.
all the trees in lebanon are not enough to burn on the altar for the lord.
and all the animals in lebanon are not enough to kill for a sacrifice.
compared to god, all the nations of the world are nothing.
compared to him, they are worth nothing at all.
can you compare god to anything?
can you make a picture of god?
no, but some people make statues from rock or wood, and they call them gods.
one worker makes a statue.
then another worker covers it with gold and makes silver chains for it.
for the base he chooses special wood, a kind of wood that will not rot.
then he finds a good wood worker, and the worker makes a “god” that will not fall over.
surely you know the truth, don’t you?
surely you have heard.
surely someone told you long ago.
surely you understand who made the earth.
it is the lord who sits above the circle of the earth.
and compared to him, people are like grasshoppers.
he rolled open the skies like a piece of cloth.
he stretched out the skies like a tent to sit under.
he takes away the power of rulers.
he makes the world’s leaders completely worthless.
they are like plants that are planted in the ground.
but before they can send their roots into the ground, god blows on the “plants”; they become dead and dry, and the wind blows them away like straw.
the holy one says, “can you compare me to anyone?
no one is equal to me.” 
look up to the skies.
who created all those stars?
who created all those “armies” in the sky?
who knows every star by name?
he is very strong and powerful, so not one of these stars is lost.
people of jacob, this is true.
israel, you should believe it.
so why do you say, “the lord cannot see the way i live; he will not find me and punish me”?
surely you know the truth.
surely you have heard.
the lord is the god who lives forever!
he created all the faraway places on earth.
he does not get tired and weary.
you cannot learn all he knows.
he helps tired people be strong.
he gives power to those without it.
young men get tired and need to rest.
even young boys stumble and fall.
but those who trust in the lord will become strong again.
they will be like eagles that grow new feathers.
they will run and not get weak.
they will walk and not get tired.
chapter 27.
the word of the lord came to me again.
he said, 
“son of man, sing this sad song about tyre.
say this about tyre: ‘tyre, you are the door to the seas.
you are the merchant for many nations.
you travel to many countries along the coast.
this is what the lord god says: “tyre, you think that you are so beautiful.
you think you are perfectly beautiful!
the mediterranean sea is the border around your city.
your builders made you perfectly beautiful, like the ships that sail from you.
your builders used cypress trees from the mountains of senir to make your planks.
they used cedar trees from lebanon to make your mast.
they used oak trees from bashan to make your oars.
they used pine trees from cyprus to make the cabin on your deck.
they decorated that shelter with ivory.
for your sail, they used colorful linen made in egypt.
that sail was your flag.
the coverings over your cabin were blue and purple.
they came from the coast of cyprus.
men from sidon and arvad rowed your boats for you.
tyre, your wise men were the pilots on your ships.
the elders and wise men from byblos were on board to help put caulking between the boards on your ship.
all the ships of the sea and their sailors came to trade and do business with you.
“‘men from persia, lud, and put were in your army.
they were your men of war who hung their shields and helmets on your walls.
they brought honor and glory to your city.
men from arvad and cilicia were guards standing on the wall around your city.
men from gammad were in your towers.
they hung their shields on the walls around your city and made your beauty complete.
“‘tarshish was one of your best customers.
they traded silver, iron, tin, and lead for all the wonderful things you sold.
people in greece, turkey, and the area around the black sea traded with you.
they traded slaves and bronze for the things you sold.
people from the nation of togarmah traded horses, war horses, and mules for the things you sold.
the people of rhodes traded with you.
you sold your things in many places.
people brought ivory tusks and ebony wood to pay you.
aram traded with you because you had so many good things.
they traded emeralds, purple cloth, fine needlework, fine linen, coral, and rubies for the things you sold.
“‘the people in judah and israel traded with you.
they paid for the things you sold with the wheat, olives, early figs, honey, oil, and balm.
damascus was a good customer.
they traded with you for the many wonderful things you had.
they traded wine from helbon and white wool for those things.
damascus traded wine from uzal for the things you sold.
they paid with wrought iron, cassia, and sugar cane.
dedan provided good business and traded with you for saddle blankets and riding horses.
arabia and all the leaders of kedar traded lambs, rams, and goats for your goods.
the merchants of sheba and raamah traded with you.
they traded all the best spices and every kind of precious stone and gold for your goods.
haran, canneh, eden, the merchants of sheba, asshur, and kilmad traded with you.
they paid with the finest clothing, blue cloth, cloth with fine needlework, rugs of many colors, and the strongest ropes.
these were the things they traded with you.
the ships from tarshish carried the things you sold.
“‘tyre, you are like one of those cargo ships.
you are on the sea, loaded with many riches.
your oarsmen rowed you far out to sea.
but a powerful east wind will destroy your ship at sea.
all your wealth will spill into the sea.
your wealth—the things you buy and sell—will spill into the sea.
your whole crew—sailors, pilots, and the men who put caulking between the boards on your ship— will spill into the sea.
the merchants and soldiers in your city will all sink into the sea.
that will happen on the day that you are destroyed!
“‘you send your merchants to faraway places.
those places will shake with fear when they hear your pilots’ cry!
your whole crew will jump ship.
the sailors and pilots will jump ship and swim to the shore.
they will be very sad about you.
they will cry, throw dust on their heads, and roll in ashes.
they will shave their heads for you.
they will put on sackcloth.
they will cry for you like someone crying for someone who died.
“‘and in their loud crying they will sing this sad song about you: “‘no one is like tyre!
tyre is destroyed, in the middle of the sea!
your merchants sailed across the seas.
you satisfied many people with your great wealth and the things you sold.
you made the kings of the earth rich!
but now you are broken by the seas and by the deep waters.
all the things you sell and all your people have fallen.
all the people living on the coast are shocked about you.
their kings are terrified.
their faces show their shock.
the merchants in other nations whistle about you.
what happened to you will frighten people, because you were destroyed.
you are gone forever.’” 
2 chronicles.
chapter 13.
abijah became the new king of judah.
this was during the 18th year that jeroboam son of nebat ruled israel.
abijah ruled in jerusalem for three years.
his mother’s name was maacah.
she was the daughter of uriel, from the town of gibeah.
and there was war between abijah and jeroboam.
abijah’s army had 400,000 brave soldiers.
abijah led that army into battle.
jeroboam’s army had 800,000 brave soldiers.
jeroboam got ready to have a war with abijah.
then abijah stood on mount zemaraim in the hill country of ephraim and said, “jeroboam and all israel, listen to me!
you should know that the lord, the god of israel, gave david and his sons the right to be king over israel forever.
god gave this right to david with an agreement of salt.
but jeroboam turned against his master.
jeroboam son of nebat was one of the servants of david’s son solomon.
then worthless, evil men became friends with jeroboam.
then jeroboam and the bad men turned against rehoboam, solomon’s son.
rehoboam was young and did not have experience.
so he could not stop jeroboam and his bad friends.
“now, you people have decided to defeat the lord’s kingdom—the kingdom that is ruled by david’s sons.
you have so many people with you and you have the golden calves—the ‘gods’ that jeroboam made for you.
you threw out the lord’s priests, the descendants of aaron.
and you threw out the levites.
then you chose your own priests, as every other nation on earth does.
and now, anyone who will bring a young bull and seven rams can become a priest to serve these ‘no-gods.’ 
“but as for us, the lord is our god.
we people of judah have not refused to obey god.
we have not left him.
the priests who serve the lord are aaron’s sons, and the levites help the priests in their work.
they offer burnt offerings and burn incense of spices to the lord every morning and every evening.
they put the bread in rows on the special table in the temple.
and they take care of the lamps on the golden lampstand so that it shines bright each and every evening.
we very carefully serve the lord our god, but you people have abandoned him.
god himself is with us.
he is our ruler, and his priests are with us.
god’s priests blow his trumpets to wake you up and make you excited about coming to him.
men of israel, don’t fight against the lord, god of your ancestors, because you will not succeed!” 
but jeroboam sent a group of soldiers to sneak behind abijah’s army.
jeroboam’s army was in front of abijah’s army.
the hidden soldiers from jeroboam’s army were behind abijah’s army.
when the soldiers in abijah’s army from judah looked around, they saw jeroboam’s army attacking both in front and in back.
the men of judah shouted out to the lord and the priests blew the trumpets.
then the men in abijah’s army shouted.
when the men of judah shouted, god defeated jeroboam’s army.
jeroboam’s whole army from israel was defeated by abijah’s army from judah.
the men of israel ran away from the men of judah.
god let the army from judah defeat the army from israel.
abijah’s army greatly defeated the army of israel, and 500,000 of the best men of israel were killed.
so at that time the israelites were defeated, and the people of judah won.
the army from judah won because they depended on the lord, the god of their ancestors.
abijah’s army chased jeroboam’s army, and they captured the towns of bethel, jeshanah, and ephron from jeroboam.
they captured the towns and the small villages near them.
jeroboam never became strong again while abijah lived.
the lord killed jeroboam, 
but abijah became strong.
he married 14 women and was the father of 22 sons and 16 daughters.
everything else abijah did is written in the books of the prophet iddo.
chapter 2.
“then you will say to your brothers, ‘you are my people,’ and you will say to your sisters, ‘he has shown mercy to you.’” 
“argue with your mother.
argue with her because she is no longer my wife, and i am no longer her husband!
tell her to stop being like a prostitute.
tell her to take away her lovers from between her breasts.
if she refuses to stop her adultery, i will strip her naked and leave her like the day she was born.
i will take away her people, and she will be like an empty, dry desert.
i will kill her with thirst.
i will have no pity on her children because they are the children of prostitution.
their mother has acted like a prostitute.
she should be ashamed of what she did.
she said, ‘i will go to my lovers, who give me food and water, wool and linen, wine and olive oil.’ 
“so i, the lord, will block israel’s road with thorns, and i will build a wall.
then she will not be able to find her path.
she will run after her lovers, but she will not be able to catch up with them.
she will look for her lovers, but she will not be able to find them.
then she will say, ‘i will go back to my husband.
life was better for me when i was with him.
life was better then than it is now.’ 
“israel didn’t know that i, the lord, was the one who gave her grain, wine, and oil.
i kept giving her more and more silver and gold, but she used this silver and gold to make statues of baal.
so i will return and take back my grain at the time it is ready to be harvested.
i will take back my wine at the time the grapes are ready.
i will take back my wool and linen.
i gave those things to her so that she could cover her naked body.
now i will strip her.
she will be naked, so all her lovers can see her.
no one will be able to save her from my power.
i will take away all her fun.
i will stop her festivals, her new moon celebrations, and her days of rest.
i will stop all her special feasts.
i will destroy her vines and fig trees.
she said, ‘my lovers gave these things to me.’ but i will change her gardens—they will become like a wild forest.
wild animals will come and eat from those plants.
“israel served false gods, so i will punish her.
she burned incense to those false gods.
she dressed up—she put on her jewelry and nose ring.
then she went to her lovers and forgot me.” this is what the lord has said.
“so i, the lord, will speak romantic words to her.
i will lead her into the desert and speak tender words.
there i will give her vineyards.
i will give her achor valley as a doorway of hope.
then she will answer as she did when she came out of the land of egypt.” 
this is what the lord says.
“at that time you will call me ‘my husband.’ you will not call me ‘my baal.’ 
i will take the names of those false gods out of her mouth.
then people will not use those names again.
“at that time i will make an agreement for the israelites with the animals of the field, the birds of the sky, and the crawling things on the ground.
i will break the bow, the sword, and the weapons of war in that land.
i will make the land safe, so the people of israel can lie down in peace.
and i will make you my bride forever.
i will make you my bride with goodness and justice and with love and mercy.
i will make you my faithful bride.
then you will really know the lord.
and at that time i will answer.” this is what the lord says.
“i will speak to the skies, and they will give rain to the earth.
the earth will produce grain, wine, and oil, and they will meet jezreel’s needs.
i will sow her many seeds on her land.
to lo-ruhamah, i will show mercy.
to lo-ammi, i will say, ‘you are my people.’ and they will say to me, ‘you are our god.’” 
1 kings.
chapter 14.
at that time jeroboam’s son abijah became very sick.
jeroboam said to his wife, “go to shiloh and see the prophet ahijah.
he is the one who said that i would become king of israel.
dress yourself so that people will not know that you are my wife.
give the prophet ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey.
then ask him what will happen to our son, and he will tell you.” 
so the king’s wife did what he said.
she went to the home of ahijah the prophet in shiloh.
ahijah was very old and had become blind.
but the lord said to him, “jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask you about her son because he is sick.
i will tell you what to say to her.” when she came to ahijah’s house, she pretended to be someone else.
but when ahijah heard her coming to the door, he said, “come in!
i know who you are.
you are jeroboam’s wife.
why are you pretending to be someone else?
i have some bad news for you.
go back and tell jeroboam that this is what the lord, the god of israel, says: ‘jeroboam, i chose you from among all the israelites.
i made you the ruler of my people.
david’s family was ruling the kingdom of israel, but i took the kingdom away from them and gave it to you.
but you are not like my servant david.
he always obeyed my commands and followed me with his whole heart.
he did only what i accepted.
but you have sinned worse than anyone who ruled before you.
you stopped following me and made other gods for yourself.
you made those statues to make me angry.
so jeroboam, i will bring troubles to your family.
i will kill all the men in your family.
i will destroy your family completely, like fire burning up dung.
anyone from your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs.
and anyone from your family who dies in the fields will be eaten by birds.
the lord has spoken.’” 
then ahijah said, “now, go home.
your son will die as soon as your enter the city.
all israel will cry for him.
they will bury him, but he is the only one from jeroboam’s family who will be buried.
this is because he is the only one in jeroboam’s family who pleased the lord, the god of israel.
soon, the lord will put a new king over israel who will destroy jeroboam’s family.
then the lord will punish israel.
the israelites will be so full of fear that they will shake like tall grass in the water.
he will pull israel up from this good land that he gave their ancestors.
he will scatter them to the other side of the euphrates river.
the lord will do this because the people made him angry when they built sacred poles.
he will let the israelites be defeated because jeroboam sinned, and then he made the israelites sin.” 
jeroboam’s wife went back to tirzah.
as soon as she stepped into the house, the boy died.
they buried him and all the people of israel cried for him.
this happened just as the lord said it would through his servant, the prophet ahijah.
the rest of what king jeroboam did is written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
it includes the wars he fought and the way he ruled.
jeroboam ruled as king for 22 years.
then he died and was buried with his ancestors.
his son nadab became the new king after him.
solomon’s son, rehoboam, was 41 years old when he became king of judah.
rehoboam ruled 17 years in jerusalem, the city the lord chose for his own.
he chose this city from all the other tribes of israel.
rehoboam’s mother was naamah.
she was an ammonite.
the people of judah did things that the lord considered evil.
they made him angry with all their sins—more than any of their ancestors had done.
they built high places, memorial stones, and sacred poles.
they built them on every high hill and under every green tree.
there were also men who served other gods by selling their bodies for sex.
so the people of judah were worse than the people who had lived in the land before them.
and the lord took the land away from those people to give it to the israelites.
in the fifth year that rehoboam was king, king shishak of egypt came to attack jerusalem.
he took the treasures from the lord’s temple and from the king’s palace.
he even took the gold shields that david had taken from the officers of king hadadezer of aram and put on the walls of jerusalem.
king rehoboam made more shields to put in their places, but they were made from bronze.
he gave them to the guards on duty at the palace gates.
every time the king went to the lord’s temple, the guards took out the shields and went with him.
after they were finished, they put the shields back on the wall in the guardroom.
the rest of what king rehoboam did is written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
rehoboam and jeroboam were always fighting against each other.
rehoboam died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of david.
(his mother was naamah.
she was an ammonite.)
rehoboam’s son abijah became the next king after him.
chapter 8.
this is a message from the lord all-powerful.
the lord all-powerful says, “i have a very strong love for mount zion.
i love her so much that i became angry when she was not faithful to me.” 
the lord says, “i have come back to zion, and i am living in jerusalem.
jerusalem will be called faithful city.
the mountain of the lord all-powerful will be called holy mountain.” 
the lord all-powerful says, “old men and women will again be seen in the public places in jerusalem.
people will live so long that they will need their walking sticks.
and the city will be filled with children playing in the streets.” 
the lord all-powerful says, “the survivors will think it is wonderful, and so will i!” 
the lord all-powerful says, “look, i am rescuing my people from countries in the east and west.
i will bring them back here, and they will live in jerusalem.
they will be my people, and i will be their good and faithful god.” 
the lord all-powerful says, “be strong!
you people are hearing the same message today that the prophets gave when the lord all-powerful first laid the foundations to rebuild his temple.
before that time, people didn’t have the money to hire workers or to rent animals.
and it was not safe for people to come and go.
there was no relief from all the troubles.
i had turned everyone against their neighbor.
but it is not like that now.
it will not be like that for the survivors.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“these people will plant in peace.
their grapevines will produce grapes.
the land will give good crops, and the skies will give rain.
i will give all these things to my people.
people began using the names israel and judah in their curses.
but i will save israel and judah, and their names will become a blessing.
so don’t be afraid.
be strong!” 
the lord all-powerful says, “your ancestors made me angry, so i decided to destroy them.
i decided not to change my mind.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“but now i have changed my mind.
and in the same way i have decided to be good to jerusalem and to the people of judah.
so don’t be afraid!
but you must do this: tell the truth to your neighbors.
when you make decisions in your cities, be fair and do what is right.
do what brings peace.
don’t make secret plans to hurt your neighbors.
don’t make false promises.
you must not enjoy doing these things, because i hate them!” this is what the lord said.
i received this message from the lord all-powerful.
the lord all-powerful says, “you have special days of sadness and fasting in the fourth month, the fifth month, the seventh month, and the tenth month.
these days of sadness must be changed into days of happiness.
they will be good and happy festivals.
and you must love truth and peace.” 
the lord all-powerful says, “in the future, people from many cities will come to jerusalem.
people from different cities will greet each other and say, ‘we are going to worship the lord all-powerful.’ and the other person will say, ‘i would like to go with you!’” 
many people and many powerful nations will come to jerusalem to find the lord all-powerful and to worship him.
the lord all-powerful says, “at that time many foreigners speaking different languages will come to a jewish man, take hold of the hem of his robe, and ask, ‘we heard that god is with you.
can we come with you to worship him?’” 
genesis.
chapter 32.
jacob also left that place.
while he was traveling, he saw god’s angels.
when he saw them, he said, “this is god’s camp!” so jacob named that place mahanaim.
jacob’s brother esau was living in the area called seir in the hill country of edom.
jacob sent messengers to esau.
he told them, “tell this to my master esau: ‘your servant jacob says, i have lived with laban all these years.
i have many cattle, donkeys, flocks, and servants.
sir, i am sending you this message to ask you to accept us.’” 
the messengers came back to jacob and said, “we went to your brother esau.
he is coming to meet you.
he has 400 men with him.” 
jacob was very frightened and worried.
he divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two groups.
jacob thought, “if esau comes and destroys one group, the other group can run away and be saved.” 
then jacob said, “god of my father abraham!
god of my father isaac!
lord, you told me to come back to my country and to my family.
you said that you would do good to me.
you have been very kind to me.
you did many good things for me.
the first time i traveled across the jordan river, i owned nothing—only my walking stick.
but now i own enough things to have two full groups.
i ask you to please save me from my brother esau.
i am afraid that he will come and kill us all, even the mothers with the children.
lord, you said to me, ‘i will be good to you.
i will increase your family and make your children as many as the sands of the sea.
there will be too many to count.’” 
jacob stayed in that place for the night.
he prepared some things to give to esau as a gift.
he took 200 female goats and 20 male goats, 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep.
he took 30 camels and their colts, 40 cows and 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys.
he gave each flock of animals to his servants.
then he said to them, “separate each group of animals.
go ahead of me and keep some space between each herd.” 
jacob gave them their orders.
to the servant with the first group of animals he said, “when esau my brother comes to you and asks you, ‘whose animals are these?
where are you going?
whose servant are you?’ 
then you should answer, ‘these animals belong to your servant jacob.
he sent them as a gift to you, my master esau.
and he also is coming behind us.’” 
jacob also ordered the second servant, the third servant, and all the other servants to do the same thing.
he said, “you will say the same thing to esau when you meet him.
you will say, ‘this is a gift to you, and your servant jacob is behind us.’” jacob thought, “if i send these men ahead with gifts, maybe esau will forgive me and accept me.” 
so jacob sent the gifts to esau, but he stayed that night in the camp.
during the night, jacob got up and began moving his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven sons across the jabbok river at the crossing.
after he sent his family across the river, he sent across everything he had.
jacob was left alone, and a man came and wrestled with him.
the man fought with him until the sun came up.
when the man saw that he could not defeat jacob, he touched jacob’s leg and put it out of joint.
then the man said to jacob, “let me go.
the sun is coming up.” but jacob said, “i will not let you go.
you must bless me.” 
and the man said to him, “what is your name?” and jacob said, “my name is jacob.” 
then the man said, “your name will not be jacob.
your name will now be israel.
i give you this name because you have fought with god and with men, and you have won.” 
then jacob asked him, “please tell me your name.” but the man said, “why do you ask my name?” then the man blessed jacob at that place.
so jacob named that place peniel.
he said, “at this place, i saw god face to face, but my life was spared.” 
then the sun came up as jacob left peniel.
he was limping because of his leg.
so even today, the people of israel don’t eat the muscle that is on the hip joint, because this is the muscle where jacob was hurt.
chapter 33.
look at you.
you attack others when you have not been attacked.
you turn against others when no one has turned against you.
so when you stop your attacks, you will be attacked.
when you stop turning against others, they will turn against you.
lord, be kind to us.
we have waited for your help.
give us strength every morning.
save us when we are in trouble.
your powerful voice makes people run away in fear.
your greatness causes the nations to run away.
you people stole things in war.
those things will be taken from you.
many will come and take your wealth.
it will be like the times when locusts come and eat all your crops.
the lord is very great.
he lives in a very high place.
he fills zion with justice and goodness.
jerusalem, you are rich with wisdom and knowledge of god.
you are rich with salvation.
you respect the lord, and that makes you rich.
but listen!
the messengers are crying outside.
the messengers who bring peace are crying very hard.
the roads are empty; there is no one walking along the paths.
people don’t respect each other.
they have broken the agreements they made, and they refuse to believe what witnesses tell them.
the land is sick and dying.
lebanon is dying and sharon valley is dry and empty.
bashan and carmel once grew beautiful plants—but now those plants have stopped growing.
the lord says, “now, i will stand and show people how great and powerful i am.
you people have done useless things.
these things are like hay and straw.
they are worth nothing!
your breath will be like a fire and burn you.
people will be burned until their bones become lime.
they will burn quickly like thorns and dry bushes.
“you people in faraway lands, listen to what i have done.
you people who are near me, learn about my power.” 
the sinners in zion are afraid.
those who do wrong shake with fear.
they say, “can any of us live through this fire that destroys?
who can live near this fire that burns forever?” 
good, honest people who refuse to hurt others for money will live through that fire.
they refuse to take bribes or listen to plans to murder other people.
they refuse to look at plans for doing bad things.
they will live safely in high places.
they will be protected in high rock fortresses.
they will always have food and water.
your eyes will see the king in his beauty.
you will see the great land.
when you think about the troubles you had in the past, you will wonder, “where are those foreigners who spoke languages we could not understand.
where are the officials and tax collectors from other lands?
where are the spies who counted our defense towers?” 
look at zion, the city of our religious festivals.
look at jerusalem—that beautiful place of rest.
jerusalem is like a tent that will never be moved.
the pegs that hold her in place will never be pulled up.
her ropes will never be broken, 
because the lord is our powerful leader there.
that land is a place with streams and wide rivers, but there will be no enemy boats or powerful ships on those rivers.
you men who work on such boats can stop your work with the ropes.
you cannot make the mast strong enough.
you will not be able to open your sails, because the lord is our judge.
he makes our laws.
he is our king.
he saves us.
the lord will give us our wealth.
even crippled people will get their share.
no one living there will say, “i am sick,” because everyone living there has had their guilt removed.
chapter 2.
then another day came for the angels to meet with the lord.
satan joined them for this meeting with the lord.
the lord said to satan, “where have you been?” satan answered the lord, “i have been roaming around the earth, going from place to place.” 
then the lord said to satan, “have you noticed my servant job?
there is no one on earth like him.
he is a good, faithful man.
he respects god and refuses to do evil.
he is still faithful, even though you asked me to let you destroy, without reason, everything he has.” 
satan answered, “skin for skin!
a man will give everything he has to protect himself.
i swear, if you attack his flesh and bones, he will curse you to your face!” 
so the lord said to satan, “all right, job is in your hands, but you are not allowed to kill him.” 
so satan left the meeting with the lord and gave job painful sores all over his body, from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head.
job sat on the pile of ashes where he was mourning and used a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores.
his wife said to him, “are you still holding on to your faith?
why don’t you just curse god and die!” 
job answered, “you sound like one of those fools on the street corner!
how can we accept all the good things that god gives us and not accept the problems?” so even after all that happened to job, he did not sin.
he did not accuse god of doing anything wrong.
job’s three friends heard about all the bad things that happened to him, so eliphaz came from teman, bildad from shuah, and zophar from naamah.
they met together and went to comfort job and show him their sympathy.
but his friends didn’t even recognize him when they first saw him in the distance!
they began to cry loudly.
they tore their clothes and threw dirt in the air over their heads to show how sad they were.
then they sat on the ground with job for seven days and seven nights.
they didn’t say a word, because they saw he was in so much pain.
chapter 4.
children, listen to your father’s teaching.
pay attention and you will learn how to learn.
the advice i give is good, so don’t ever forget what i teach you.
when i was my father’s little boy and my mother’s dear son, 
my father taught me this: “pay attention to what i say.
obey my commands and you will have a good life.
try to get wisdom and understanding.
don’t forget my teaching or ignore what i say.
don’t turn away from wisdom, and she will protect you.
love her, and she will keep you safe.
“the first step to becoming wise is to look for wisdom, so use everything you have to get understanding.
love wisdom, and she will make you great.
hold on to wisdom, and she will bring you honor.
wisdom will reward you with a crown of honor and glory.” 
son, listen to me.
do what i say, and you will live a long time.
i am teaching you about wisdom and guiding you on the right path.
as you walk on it, you will not step into a trap.
even if you run, you will not trip and fall.
always remember this teaching.
don’t forget it.
it is the key to life, so guard it well.
don’t take the path of the wicked; don’t follow those who do evil.
stay away from that path; don’t even go near it.
turn around and go another way.
the wicked cannot sleep until they have done something evil.
they will not rest until they bring someone down.
evil and violence are their food and drink.
the path of those who live right is like the early morning light.
it gets brighter and brighter until the full light of day.
but the path of the wicked is like a dark night.
they trip and fall over what they cannot see.
my son, pay attention to what i say.
listen closely to my words.
don’t let them out of your sight.
never stop thinking about them.
these words are the secret of life and health to all who discover them.
above all, be careful what you think because your thoughts control your life.
don’t bend the truth or say things that you know are not right.
keep your eyes on the path, and look straight ahead.
make sure you are going the right way, and nothing will make you fall.
don’t go to the right or to the left, and you will stay away from evil.
chapter 14.
some of the elders of israel came to me.
they sat down to talk with me.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, these men came to talk to you.
but they still have their filthy idols.
they kept the things that made them sin.
they still worship those statues, so why do they come to me for advice?
should i answer their questions?
but i will give them an answer.
you must tell them this: ‘this is what the lord god says: if any israelites come to a prophet and ask me for advice, i myself will answer their questions.
i, the lord, will answer them even if they still have their filthy idols, even if they kept the things that made them sin, and even if they still worship those statues.
i will speak to them in spite of all their filthy idols.
this is because i want to touch their hearts.
i want to show them that i love them, even though they left me for their filthy idols.’ 
“so tell the family of israel, ‘this is what the lord god says: come back to me and leave your filthy idols.
turn away from those terrible, false gods.
if any israelites or foreigners who live in israel come to me for advice, i will give them an answer.
i, the lord, will answer them even if they still have their filthy idols, even if they kept the things that made them sin, and even if they worship those statues.
this is the answer i will give them: 
i will turn against them and destroy them.
they will be an example to others.
people will laugh at them.
i will remove them from my people.
then you will know that i am the lord!
and if a prophet is foolish enough to give his own answer, i, the lord, will show him how foolish he is!
i will use my power against him.
i will destroy him and remove him from among my people, israel.
so both the one who came for advice and the prophet who gave an answer will get the same punishment.
so that those prophets will stop leading my people away from me, and my people will stop being filthy with sin.
then they will be my special people, and i will be their god.’” this is what the lord god said.
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, i will punish any nation that leaves me and sins against me.
i will stop their food supply.
i might cause a famine and remove the people and animals from that country.
i would punish that country even if noah, daniel, and job lived there.
they could save their own lives by their goodness, but they could not save the whole country.” this is what the lord god said.
“or i might send wild animals through that country to kill all the people.
then no one would travel through that country because of the wild animals.
if noah, daniel, and job lived there, those three men could save their own lives.
but i promise by my own life that they could not save the lives of other people—not even their own sons and daughters!
that evil country would be destroyed.” this is what the lord god said.
“or i might send an enemy army to fight against that country.
the soldiers would destroy that country—i would remove all the people and animals from that country.
if noah, daniel, and job lived there, those three men could save their own lives.
but i promise by my own life that they could not save the lives of other people—not even their own sons and daughters!
that evil country would be destroyed.” this is what the lord god said.
“or i might send a disease against that country.
i will pour my anger down on the people.
i will remove all the people and animals from that country.
if noah, daniel, and job lived there, those three men could save their own lives because they are good men.
but i promise by my own life that they could not save the lives of other people—not even their own sons and daughters!” this is what the lord god said.
then the lord god said, “so think how bad it will be for jerusalem.
i will send all four of those punishments against that city!
i will send enemy soldiers, hunger, disease, and wild animals against that city.
i will remove all the people and animals from that country.
some of the people will escape from that country.
they will bring their sons and daughters and come to you for help.
then you will see how bad those people really are, and you will feel better about all the troubles that i am bringing to jerusalem.
you will see how they live and all the bad things they do.
then you will know that i had a good reason for punishing them.” this is what the lord god said.
chapter 8.
then the lord said to joshua, “don’t be afraid; don’t give up.
lead all your fighting men to ai.
i will help you defeat the king of ai.
i am giving you his people, his city, and his land.
you will do to ai and its king the same thing you did to jericho and its king.
only this time you can take all the wealth and animals and keep it for yourselves.
you will share the wealth with your people.
now, tell some of your soldiers to hide behind the city.” 
so joshua led his whole army toward ai.
then joshua chose 30,000 of his best fighting men and sent them out at night.
joshua gave them this command: “listen carefully to what i tell you.
you must hide in the area behind the city.
wait for the time to attack.
don’t go far from the city.
continue to watch and be ready.
i will lead the men with me; we will march toward the city.
the men in the city will come out to fight against us.
we will turn and run away from them as we did before.
these men will chase us away from the city, so we will run away.
they will think that we are running away from them as we did before.
then you should come out of your hiding place and take control of the city.
the lord your god will give you the power to win.
“you must do what the lord says.
watch me and i will give you the command to attack the city.
when you have taken control of the city, burn it.” 
then joshua sent them to their hiding place and waited.
they went to a place west of ai, between bethel and ai.
but joshua stayed the night with his people.
early the next morning joshua gathered the men together.
then joshua and the leaders of israel led the men to ai.
all the soldiers who were with joshua marched to ai.
they stopped in front of the city.
the army made its camp north of the city.
there was a valley between the army and ai.
then joshua chose about 5000 men.
he sent these men to hide in the area west of the city, between bethel and ai.
so joshua had prepared his men for the fight.
the main camp was north of the city.
the other men were hiding to the west.
that night joshua went down into the valley.
later, the king of ai saw the army of israel.
the king and his people hurried out to fight the army of israel.
the king of ai went out the east side of the city toward the jordan valley, so he did not see the soldiers hiding behind the city.
joshua and all the men of israel let the army of ai push them back.
joshua and his men began running east toward the desert.
the people in the city began to shout and started to chase them.
all the people left the city.
all the men of ai and bethel chased the army of israel.
the city was left open—no one stayed to protect the city.
then the lord said to joshua, “hold your spear toward the city of ai, because i will give you that city.” so joshua held his spear toward the city of ai.
when the israelites who were hiding saw this, they quickly came out from their hiding place and hurried toward the city.
they entered the city and took control of it.
then the soldiers started fires to burn the city.
the men from ai looked back and saw their city burning.
when they saw the smoke rising into the sky, they lost their strength and courage.
they stopped chasing the men of israel.
the israelites stopped running away.
they turned and went to fight the men from ai.
there was no safe place for the men from ai to run to.
when joshua and his men saw that his army had taken control of the city and that smoke was rising from it, they stopped running away and turned to fight the men of ai.
then the men who were hiding came out of the city to help with the fight.
the army of israel was on both sides of the men of ai—the men of ai were trapped.
israel defeated them.
they fought until none of the men from ai were left alive—none of the enemy escaped.
but the king of ai was left alive.
joshua’s men brought him to joshua.
during the fighting, the army of israel chased the men from ai into the fields and into the desert.
so the army of israel finished killing all the men from ai in the fields and in the desert.
then the israelites went back to ai and killed all the people who were still alive in the city.
all the people of ai died that day; there were 12,000 men and women.
joshua had held his spear toward ai as a sign to his people to destroy the city.
and he did not stop until all the people of ai were destroyed.
the israelites kept the animals and other things from the city for themselves.
this is what the lord said they could do when he gave joshua the commands.
then joshua burned the city of ai.
that city became an empty pile of rocks.
it is still like that today.
joshua hanged the king of ai on a tree and left him hanging there until evening.
at sunset joshua told his men to take the king’s body down from the tree.
they threw his body down at the city gate.
then they covered the body with many rocks.
that pile of rocks is still there today.
then joshua built an altar for the lord, the god of israel.
he built the altar on mount ebal.
the lord’s servant moses told the israelites how to build altars.
so joshua built the altar the way it was explained in the book of the law of moses.
the altar was made from stones that were not cut.
no tool had ever been used on those stones.
they offered burnt offerings to the lord on that altar.
they also gave fellowship offerings.
there joshua copied onto the stones the law moses had written down.
this was for all the people of israel to see.
the elders, officers, judges, and all the israelites were standing around the box of the lord’s agreement.
they were standing in front of the priests, the levites who carried the holy box.
the israelites and the other people with them were all standing there.
half of the people stood in front of mount ebal and the other half of the people stood in front of mount gerizim.
the lord’s servant moses had told the people to do this.
he told them to do this to be blessed.
then joshua read all the words from the law.
he read the blessings and the curses.
he read everything the way it was written in the book of the law.
all the israelites were gathered together there.
all the women and children and all the foreigners who lived with the israelites were there.
and joshua read every command that moses had given.

chapter 18.
later, david attacked the philistines and defeated them.
he took the town of gath and the other small towns around it from the philistines.
then david defeated the country of moab.
the moabites became david’s servants and brought tribute to him.
david also fought against hadadezer’s army.
hadadezer was the king of zobah.
david fought against that army all the way to the town of hamath.
david did this when he went to set up a monument for himself at the euphrates river.
david took 1000 chariots, 7000 chariot drivers, and 20,000 soldiers from hadadezer.
david also crippled most of hadadezer’s horses that were used for pulling chariots.
but david saved enough horses to pull 100 chariots.
the arameans from the city of damascus came to help king hadadezer of zobah.
but david defeated and killed 22,000 aramean soldiers.
then david put fortresses in the city of damascus in aram.
the arameans became david’s servants and brought tribute to him.
so the lord gave victory to david everywhere he went.
david took the gold shields from hadadezer’s army leaders and brought them to jerusalem.
david also took much bronze from the towns of tebah and cun.
these towns belonged to hadadezer.
later, solomon used this bronze to make the bronze tank, the bronze columns, and other things made from bronze for the temple.
tou was king of the city of hamath.
hadadezer was the king of zobah.
tou heard that david had defeated all of hadadezer’s army.
so tou sent his son hadoram to king david to ask for peace and to bless him.
he did this because david had fought against hadadezer and defeated him.
hadadezer had been at war with tou before.
hadoram gave david all kinds of things made of gold, silver, and bronze.
king david made these things holy and gave them to the lord.
david did the same thing with all the silver and gold he had gotten from edom, moab, the ammonites, the philistines, and amalekites.
abishai son of zeruiah killed 18,000 edomites in the valley of salt.
abishai also put fortresses in edom and all the edomites became david’s servants.
the lord gave david victory everywhere he went.
david was king over all israel.
he did what was right and fair for everyone.
joab son of zeruiah was the commander of david’s army.
jehoshaphat son of ahilud wrote about the things david did.
zadok and abimelech were the priests.
zadok was ahitub’s son, and abimelech was abiathar’s son.
shavsha was the scribe.
benaiah was responsible for leading the kerethite and pelethites.
benaiah was jehoiada’s son.
and david’s sons were important officials.
they served at king david’s side.
chapter 4.
see how the gold has grown dark, how the pure gold has changed.
there are jewels scattered all around at every street corner.
the precious people of zion were once worth more than gold.
but now they are treated like something worthless, like the cheap clay jars a potter makes.
even a wild dog feeds her babies.
even the jackal lets her pups suck at her breast.
but the daughter of my people is cruel.
she is like the ostrich in the desert that forgets its eggs in the sand.
babies are so thirsty their tongues stick to the roof of their mouths.
young children ask for bread, but no one gives them any.
those who ate rich food are now dying in the streets.
those who grew up wearing nice red clothes now pick through garbage piles.
the sin of the daughter of my people was very great.
their sin was greater than the sins of sodom and gomorrah.
sodom and gomorrah were destroyed suddenly.
no human hand caused their destruction.
some of the men of judah were dedicated to god in a special way.
they were very pure.
they were whiter than snow, and whiter than milk.
their bodies were red like coral and their beards like sapphire stones.
but now their faces are blacker than soot.
no one even recognizes them in the streets.
their skin is wrinkled over their bones.
their skin is like wood.
it was better for those who were killed by the sword than for those who died of hunger.
those starving people were sad and hurt.
they died because they got no food from the field.
then even nice women cooked their own children.
the children were food for their mothers.
this happened when my people were destroyed.
the lord used all of his anger.
he poured out all his anger.
he made a fire in zion that burned it down to the foundations.
the kings of the earth could not believe what had happened.
the people of the world could not believe what had happened.
they could not believe that enemies would be able to come through the city gates of jerusalem.
this happened because the prophets of jerusalem sinned.
this happened because the priests of jerusalem did evil things.
they were shedding the blood of good people in the city of jerusalem.
the prophets and priests walked around like blind men in the streets.
they had become dirty with blood.
no one could even touch their clothes because they were dirty.
people shouted, “go away!
go away!
don’t touch us.” they wandered around and had no home.
people in other nations said, “we don’t want them to live with us.” 
the lord himself destroyed them.
he didn’t look after them anymore.
he didn’t respect the priests.
he was not friendly to the elders of judah.
we have worn out our eyes looking for help, but no help comes.
we kept on looking for a nation to save us.
we kept watch from our watchtower, but no nation came to us.
our enemies hunted us all the time.
we could not even go out into the streets.
our end came near.
our time was up.
our end came!
the men who chased us were faster than eagles in the sky.
they chased us into the mountains.
they hid in the desert to catch us.
the king was very important to us.
he was like the breath we breathe, but he was trapped by them.
the lord himself chose the king, and we said this about the king, “we will live in his shadow.
he protects us from the nations.” 
be happy, people of edom.
be happy, you who live in the land of uz.
but remember, the cup of the lord’s anger will come around to you too.
when you drink from that cup, you will get drunk and strip off all your clothes.
your punishment is complete, zion.
you will not go into captivity again.
but the lord will punish your sins, people of edom.
he will uncover your sins.
2 chronicles.
chapter 10.
jeroboam son of nebat was still in egypt where he had run away from solomon.
when he heard about solomon’s death, he returned to his city, zeredah, in the hills of ephraim.
rehoboam and all the israelites went to shechem to make rehoboam the king.
the people said to rehoboam, 
“your father forced us to work very hard.
now, make it easier for us.
stop the heavy work that your father forced us to do and we will serve you.” 
rehoboam answered, “come back to me in three days, and i will answer you.” so the people left.
there were some older men who had helped solomon make decisions when he was alive.
so king rehoboam asked these men what he should do.
he said, “how do you think i should answer the people?” 
they answered, “if you do what is good for the people, you will please them.
if you speak kindly to them, they will always work for you.” 
but rehoboam did not listen to the advice from the older men.
he asked the young men who were his friends.
rehoboam said, “the people said, ‘give us easier work than your father gave us.’ how do you think i should answer them?
what should i tell them?” 
then the young men who grew up with him answered, “those people came to you and said, ‘your father forced us to work very hard.
now make our work easier.’ so you should tell them, ‘my little finger is stronger than my father’s whole body.
my father forced you to work hard, but i will make you work much harder!
my father punished you with whips, but i will punish you with whips that have sharp metal tips.’” 
three days later, jeroboam and all the people came back to rehoboam, just as he had told them to do.
king rehoboam did not listen to the advice from the older men, and he was rude to the people.
he did what his friends told him to do and said, “my father forced you to work hard, but i will make you work much harder!
my father punished you with whips, but i will punish you with whips that have sharp metal tips.” 
so the king did not do what the people wanted.
the lord caused this to happen.
he did this in order to keep the promise he made to jeroboam son of nebat when he sent ahijah, the prophet from shiloh, to speak to him.
the israelites saw that the new king refused to listen to them, so they said to him, “we are not part of david’s family are we?
we don’t get any of jesse’s land, do we?
so, people of israel, let’s go home and let david’s son rule his own people!” so the israelites went home.
but rehoboam still ruled over the israelites who lived in the cities of judah.
a man named adoniram was one of the men who directed the workers.
king rehoboam sent adoniram to talk to the people, but the israelites threw stones at him until he died.
king rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to jerusalem.
so israel rebelled against the family of david, and that is how things are even today.
chapter 35.
during the time when jehoiakim, son of king josiah, was king of judah, the lord spoke this message to jeremiah: 
“go to the recabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the lord’s temple.
offer them wine to drink.” 
so i went to get jaazaniah son of jeremiah, who was the son of habazziniah.
and i got all of jaazaniah’s brothers and sons and the whole family of the recabites together.
then i brought them into the temple of the lord.
we went into the room of the sons of hanan, the son of igdaliah.
hanan was a man of god.
the room was next to the room where the princes of judah stay.
it was over the room of maaseiah son of shallum.
maaseiah was the doorkeeper in the temple.
then i put some bowls full of wine and some cups in front of the recabite family.
and i said to them, “drink some wine.” 
but the recabite family answered, “we never drink wine.
we never drink it because our ancestor jonadab son of recab gave us this command: ‘you and your descendants must never drink wine.
also you must never build houses, plant seeds, or plant vineyards.
you must never do any of those things.
you must live only in tents.
if you do that, you will live a long time in the land where you move from place to place.’ 
so we have obeyed everything our ancestor jonadab commanded us.
none of us ever drinks wine, and neither do our wives, sons, or daughters.
we never build houses to live in, we never own vineyards or fields, and we never plant crops.
we have lived in tents and have obeyed everything our ancestor jonadab commanded us.
but when king nebuchadnezzar of babylon attacked the country of judah, we did go into jerusalem.
we said to each other, ‘come, we must enter the city of jerusalem so that we can escape the babylonian army and the aramean army.’ so we have stayed in jerusalem.” 
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah: 
“the lord all-powerful, the god of israel, says to go to the people of judah and jerusalem and tell them this message: ‘you should learn a lesson and obey my message.’ this message is from the lord.
‘jonadab son of recab ordered his sons not to drink wine, and that command has been obeyed.
to this day the descendants of jonadab have obeyed their ancestor’s command.
they do not drink wine.
but i have given commands to you people of judah again and again, and you have not obeyed me.
time after time i have sent my servants the prophets to you.
they said, “you must each stop doing evil things and do what is right.
don’t follow other gods.
don’t worship or serve them.
if you obey me, you will live in the land i have given to you and your ancestors.” but you have not paid attention to my message.
the descendants of jonadab obeyed the commands that their ancestor gave them, but the people of judah have not obeyed me.’ 
“so this is what the lord god all-powerful, the god of israel, says: ‘i said that many bad things would happen to judah and jerusalem.
i will soon make all those bad things happen.
i spoke to the people, but they refused to listen.
i called out to them, but they didn’t answer me.’” 
then jeremiah said to the recabite family, “this is what the lord all-powerful, the god of israel, says: ‘you have obeyed the commands of your ancestor jonadab.
you have followed all of his teachings.
you have done everything he commanded.’ 
so the lord all-powerful, the god of israel, says: ‘there will always be a descendant of jonadab son of recab to serve me.’” 
1 samuel.
chapter 25.
samuel died.
all the israelites met together and mourned his death.
they buried him at his home in ramah.
then david moved to the desert of maon.
there was a very rich man living in maon.
he had 3000 sheep and 1000 goats.
that man was in carmel taking care of some business.
he went there to cut the wool from his sheep.
this man’s name was nabal.
he was from caleb’s family.
nabal’s wife was named abigail.
she was a wise and beautiful woman, but nabal was a mean and cruel man.
david was in the desert when he heard that nabal was cutting the wool from his sheep.
david sent ten young men to talk to nabal.
he told them, “go to carmel.
find nabal and tell him ‘hello’ for me.” 
david gave them this message for nabal: “may you and your family be well and all that you own be well.
i heard that you are cutting wool from your sheep.
your shepherds were with us for a while, and we did nothing wrong to them.
we never took anything from your shepherds while they were at carmel.
ask your servants and they will tell you this is true.
please be kind to my young men.
we come to you now, at this happy time.
please give these young men anything you can.
please do this for me, your friend david.” 
david’s men went to nabal.
they gave his message to nabal, 
but nabal said, “who is david?
who is this son of jesse?
there are many slaves who have run away from their masters these days.
i have bread and water, and i have the meat i killed for my servants who cut the wool from my sheep.
but i won’t give them to men i don’t even know.” 
david’s men went back and told him everything that nabal had said.
david’s response was, “put on your swords.” so david and his men put on their swords.
about 400 men went with david while 200 of them stayed with the supplies.
one of nabal’s servants spoke to nabal’s wife abigail.
the servant said, “david sent messengers from the desert to meet our master, but nabal was rude to them.
these men were very good to us while we were out in the fields with the sheep.
david’s men were with us the whole time, and they never did anything wrong to us.
they did not take anything from us.
his men protected us night and day.
they were like a wall around us—they protected us while we were with them caring for the sheep.
nabal was foolish to say what he did.
terrible trouble is coming to our master and all his family.
you need to think of something to do.” 
abigail quickly gathered up 200 loaves of bread, two full wine bags, five cooked sheep, about a bushel of cooked grain, about 2 quarts of raisins, and 200 cakes of pressed figs.
she put them on donkeys.
then abigail told her servants, “go on.
i’ll follow you.” but she did not tell her husband.
abigail rode her donkey down to the other side of the mountain.
she met david and his men coming from the other direction.
david was saying, “i protected nabal’s property in the desert.
i made sure not one of his sheep was missing.
i did all that for nothing.
i was good to him, but he was rude to me.
i swear, i won’t let even one man in nabal’s family live until tomorrow morning.” 
just then abigail arrived.
when she saw david, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down with her face to the ground in front of him.
abigail fell at his feet and said, “sir, please let me talk to you.
listen to what i say.
blame me for what happened.
i didn’t see the men you sent.
sir, don’t pay any attention to that worthless man, nabal.
his name means ‘foolish,’ and that is what he is.
the lord has kept you from killing innocent people.
as surely as the lord lives and you as well, may your enemies and anyone else who wants to harm you be as cursed as nabal is.
now, i am bringing this gift to you.
please give these things to your men.
please forgive me for doing wrong.
i know the lord will make your family strong because you fight his battles.
people will never find anything bad about you as long as you live.
if someone chases you to kill you, the lord your god will save your life.
but he will throw away your enemies like a stone from a sling.
the lord promised to do many good things for you, and he will keep his promises.
he will make you leader over israel.
so don’t do anything that would make you guilty of killing innocent people.
please don’t fall into that trap.
please remember me when the lord blesses you.” 
david answered abigail, “praise the lord, the god of israel.
praise god for sending you to meet me.
god bless you for your good judgment.
you kept me from killing innocent people today.
as surely as the lord, the god of israel, lives, if you hadn’t come quickly to meet me, not one man in nabal’s family would have lived until tomorrow morning.
but the lord prevented me from hurting you.” 
then david accepted abigail’s gifts.
he told her, “go home in peace.
i have listened to your request, and i will do what you asked.” 
abigail went back to nabal, who was in the house.
he had been eating like a king, and he was drunk and feeling good.
so abigail told nabal nothing until the next morning.
the next morning, nabal was sober, so his wife told him everything.
he had a heart attack and became as stiff as a rock.
about ten days later, the lord gave him a stroke and nabal died.
when david heard that nabal was dead, he said, “praise the lord!
he judged nabal to be wrong for insulting me and kept me from doing something wrong.
the lord made nabal pay for what he did.” then david sent a message to abigail and asked her to be his wife.
his servants went to carmel with this message, “david sent us to get you.
he wants you to be his wife.” 
abigail bowed her face to the ground.
she said, “i am willing to be your slave woman, even if it is only to wash the feet of my master’s servants.” 
abigail quickly got on a donkey and brought five of her maids with her.
they followed david’s messengers.
so abigail became david’s wife.
david had also married ahinoam of jezreel.
both ahinoam and abigail were david’s wives.
david was also married to saul’s daughter michal, but saul had taken her away from him and had given her to a man named palti, son of laish.
palti was from the town named gallim.
chapter 16.
you people should send a gift to the king of the land.
you should send a lamb from sela, through the desert, to the mountain in the city of jerusalem.
the women of moab try to cross the river arnon.
they run around looking for help, like little birds that have fallen from their nest.
they say, “help us!
tell us what to do.
protect us from our enemies as shade protects us from the noon sun.
we are running from our enemies.
hide us!
don’t give us to our enemies.
people from moab were forced to leave their homes.
so let them live in your land.
hide them from their enemies.” the robbing will stop.
the enemy will be defeated.
the men who hurt the people will be gone from the land.
then a new king will come.
he will be from david’s family.
he will be loyal, loving, and kind.
he will be a king who judges fairly.
he will do what is right and good.
we have heard that the people of moab are very proud and conceited.
they are hot-tempered braggers, but their boasts are only empty words.
because of their pride, everyone in moab will mourn.
they will wish for the way things used to be.
they will wish for the raisin cakes from kir hareseth.
the fields of heshbon and the vines of sibmah no longer grow grapes.
foreign rulers have destroyed the vines.
the enemy has reached jazer and has spread into the desert and down to the sea.
i will cry with the people of jazer and sibmah, because the grapes have been destroyed.
i will cry with the people of heshbon and elealeh because there will be no harvest.
there will be no summer fruit, and there will be no shouts of joy for the harvest.
there will be no joy and happiness in the orchard.
i will end the happy singing and shouting in the vineyard.
the grapes are ready to make wine, but they will all be ruined.
so i will hum a sad song for moab and kir heres, like a harp playing a funeral song.
the people of moab will go to their high places to worship.
they will go to their temple to pray, but it will not help them.
the lord said these things about moab many times.
and now the lord says, “in three years (counting as exactly as a hired helper would) all those people and the things they are proud of will be gone.
only a few of their weakest people will be left.” 
exodus.
chapter 13.
then the lord said to moses, 
“you must give me every male in israel who is his mother’s first child.
that means that every firstborn baby boy and every firstborn male animal will be mine.” 
moses said to the people, “remember this day.
you were slaves in egypt, but on this day the lord used his great power and made you free.
you must not eat bread with yeast.
today, in the month of abib, you are leaving egypt.
the lord made a special promise to your ancestors.
he promised to give you the land of the canaanites, hittites, amorites, hivites, and jebusites.
after the lord leads you to the land filled with many good things, then you must remember this day.
you must have a special day of worship on this day during the first month of every year.
“for seven days, you must eat only bread without yeast.
on the seventh day there will be a great festival to show honor to the lord.
so for seven days, you must not eat any bread made with yeast.
there must be no bread with yeast any place in your land.
on this day you should tell your children, ‘we are having this festival because the lord took me out of egypt.’ 
“this festival will help you remember; it will be like a string tied on your hand.
it will be like a sign before your eyes.
this festival will help you remember the lord’s teachings.
it will help you remember that the lord used his great power to take you out of egypt.
so remember this festival every year at the right time.
“the lord will lead you into the land he promised to give you.
the canaanites live there now.
but god promised your ancestors that he would give you this land.
when that happens, 
you must remember to give the lord every firstborn boy.
and every male animal that is the firstborn must also be given to the lord.
every firstborn donkey can be bought back.
you can offer a lamb and keep the donkey.
if you don’t want to buy back the donkey like this, then you must break its neck to kill it.
but every firstborn baby boy must be bought back from the lord.
“in the future, your children will ask why you do this.
they will say, ‘what does all this mean?’ and you will answer, ‘the lord used his great power to save us from egypt.
we were slaves in that place, but he led us out and brought us here.
in egypt, pharaoh was stubborn and refused to let us leave.
so the lord killed every firstborn in all the land.
(the lord killed the firstborn males—animal and human.)
that is why i give every firstborn male animal to the lord, and that is why i buy back each of my firstborn sons from him.’ 
this is like a string tied on your hand, like a sign in front of your eyes.
it helps you remember that the lord brought us out of egypt with his great power.” 
pharaoh made the people leave egypt.
god did not let the people take the road leading to the land of the philistines.
that road by the mediterranean sea is the shortest way, but god said, “if the people go that way they will have to fight.
then they might change their minds and go back to egypt.” 
so god led them another way through the desert by the red sea.
the israelites were dressed for war when they left egypt.
moses carried the bones of joseph with him.
before joseph died, he made the israelites promise to do this for him.
he said, “when god saves you, remember to carry my bones with you out of egypt.” 
the israelites left succoth and camped at etham.
etham was near the desert.
the lord led the way.
during the day, he used a tall cloud to lead the people.
and during the night, he used a tall column of fire to lead the way.
this fire gave them light so that they could also travel at night.
the cloud was always with them during the day, and the column of fire was always with them at night.

chapter 2.
the time came for david to die, so he gave these commands to solomon, 
“i am about to die, like all men must.
but you are growing stronger and becoming a man.
now, carefully obey all the commands of the lord your god.
carefully obey all his laws, commands, decisions, and agreements.
obey everything that is written in the law of moses.
if you do this, you will be successful at whatever you do and wherever you go.
and if you obey the lord, he will keep his promise about me.
he said, ‘if your sons carefully live the way i tell them, sincerely, with all their heart, the king of israel will always be a man from your family.’” 
david also said, “you remember what joab son of zeruiah did to me.
he killed two of the commanders of israel’s army, abner son of ner and amasa son of jether.
remember, it was during a time of peace when he spilled the blood that splattered onto his sword belt and army boots.
i should have punished him then.
use your wisdom, but don’t let him die peacefully of old age.
“also, be kind to the children of barzillai from gilead.
be friends with them, and let them eat at your table, because they helped me when i ran away from your brother absalom.
“and remember, shimei son of gera is still around.
he is the benjamite from bahurim who cursed me when i ran away to mahanaim.
but when he came down to meet me at the jordan river, i made a promise to him before the lord that i would not kill him.
now, don’t leave him unpunished.
you are a wise man.
you will know what you must do, but don’t let him die peacefully of old age.” 
then david died and was buried in the city of david.
david ruled israel 40 years.
he ruled seven years in hebron and 33 years in jerusalem.
now solomon was king.
he sat on the throne of his father david and was in complete control of his kingdom.
one day adonijah, the son of haggith, went to solomon’s mother, bathsheba.
she asked him, “do you come in peace?” adonijah answered, “yes, this is a peaceful visit.
i have something to ask you.” bathsheba said, “then speak.” 
adonijah said, “you know that at one time the kingdom was mine.
all the people of israel wanted me to be their king.
but things have changed, and now my brother is the king.
the lord chose him to be king.
but now i have one thing to ask you.
please don’t refuse me.” bathsheba answered, “what do you want?” 
adonijah said, “i know that king solomon will do whatever you ask.
so please ask him to let me marry abishag, the woman from shunem.” 
then bathsheba said, “very well, i will speak to the king for you.” 
so bathsheba went to king solomon to talk with him.
when the king saw her, he stood up, bowed before her, and then sat back down.
he told some servants to bring another throne for his mother, and she sat down at his right side.
bathsheba said to him, “i have one small thing to ask you.
please don’t refuse me.” the king answered, “ask whatever you want, mother.
i will not refuse you.” 
so bathsheba said, “let your brother adonijah marry abishag, the woman from shunem.” 
king solomon answered his mother, “why are you asking me to give abishag to adonijah?
why don’t you just ask me to give him the whole kingdom!
after all, he is my older brother, and both abiathar the priest and joab support him!” 
then solomon said, “by the lord, i swear i’ll make adonijah pay for this with his life!
the lord made me the king of israel.
he gave me the throne of my father david.
the lord kept his promise and gave the kingdom to me and my family.
now, as surely as the lord lives, i swear adonijah will die today!” 
king solomon gave the command to benaiah, and benaiah went out and killed adonijah.
then king solomon said to abiathar the priest, “i should kill you, but i will let you go back to your home in anathoth.
i will not kill you now because you helped carry the holy box of the lord god while marching with my father david.
and i know that you shared in the hard times with my father.” 
so solomon told abiathar that he could not continue to serve as a priest of the lord.
this happened as the lord said it would when he told eli the priest what would happen to him and his family.
joab had supported adonijah, but not absalom.
but when joab heard what happened to abiathar, he was frightened and ran to the tent of the lord to hold onto the horns of the altar.
someone told king solomon that joab was at the altar in the lord’s tent.
so solomon ordered benaiah to go and kill him.
benaiah went into the lord’s tent and said to joab, “the king says, ‘come out!’” but joab answered, “no, i will die here.” benaiah went back to the king and told him what joab had said.
the king commanded benaiah, “do as he says!
kill him there and take him out to bury him.
then my family and i will be free of joab’s guilt from killing innocent people.
joab killed two men who were much better than he was.
he killed abner son of ner, the commander of the army of israel, and amasa son of jether, the commander of the army of judah.
he did this without my father’s knowledge.
but now the lord will punish joab for the men he killed.
he and his family will always be guilty for their deaths.
but the lord will bring peace to david, his descendants, his family of kings, and his kingdom forever.” 
so benaiah son of jehoiada killed joab, and he was buried near his home in the desert.
solomon then made benaiah son of jehoiada the commander of the army in joab’s place.
solomon also made zadok the new high priest in abiathar’s place.
next, the king sent for shimei and said to him, “build yourself a house here in jerusalem to live in and don’t leave the city.
if you leave the city and go any further than kidron brook, you will be killed, and it will be your own fault.” 
shimei answered, “yes, my king.
i will obey you.” so shimei lived in jerusalem for a long time.
but three years later, two of shimei’s slaves ran away.
they went to king achish of gath, who was the son of maacah.
shimei heard that his slaves were in gath, 
so he saddled his donkey and went to king achish at gath to find them.
he found them there and brought them back home.
but someone told solomon that shimei had left jerusalem and gone to gath and back.
so solomon sent for him and said, “i made you promise in the lord’s name not to leave jerusalem.
and i warned you that if you went anywhere, you would die.
and you agreed to what i said.
you said that you would obey me.
so why didn’t you obey me?
why did you break your promise to the lord?
you know all the bad things you did to my father david.
now the lord will punish you for it.
but the lord will bless me and keep david’s throne before him forever.” 
then the king ordered benaiah to kill shimei, and he did.
so solomon had full control of his kingdom.

chapter 19.
king jehoshaphat of judah came back safely to his house in jerusalem.
the prophet jehu, son of hanani, went out to meet the king.
jehu said to him, “why did you help those who are wicked?
why do you love those who hate the lord?
that’s the reason the lord is angry with you now.
fortunately, you did some good things in your life.
you did remove the asherah poles from this country, and you did decide to ask god for his advice.” 
jehoshaphat lived in jerusalem, but he would go out among the people throughout judah, from beersheba to the hill country of ephraim.
he helped the people turn back to the lord, the god their ancestors worshiped.
jehoshaphat went from town to town and appointed judges in each of the fortresses of judah.
he told the judges, “be careful in what you are doing, because you are not judging for people, but for the lord.
he will be with you when you make decisions.
you must fear the lord.
protect justice and do what is right because the lord our god is fair.
he does not treat some people as if they are more important than others, and he does not accept bribes to change his judgments.” 
in jerusalem, jehoshaphat chose some of the levites, priests, and heads of the families of israel to be judges.
these men lived in jerusalem and used the law of the lord to settle problems among the people.
jehoshaphat commanded them, “you must serve faithfully with all your heart.
you must fear the lord.
people from cities around the country will bring their problems to you.
you will listen to cases where people have broken a law or a command or maybe killed someone.
in all these cases you must warn the people not to sin against the lord so that he will not get angry and punish you and your people.
“amariah is the high priest, so he will make the final decision about the people’s responsibilities to the lord.
zebadiah son of ishmael is the leader of the tribe of judah, so he will make the final decision about the people’s responsibilities to the king.
the levites will serve as scribes for you.
be brave and do what is right!
may the lord be with those of you who are good judges.”

chapter 10.
the queen of sheba heard about solomon, so she came to test him with hard questions.
she traveled to jerusalem with a very large group of servants.
there were many camels carrying spices, jewels, and a lot of gold.
she met solomon and asked him all the questions that she could think of.
solomon answered all the questions.
none of her questions was too hard for him to explain.
the queen of sheba saw that solomon was very wise.
she also saw the beautiful palace he had built.
she saw the food at the king’s table.
she saw his officials meeting together.
she saw the servants in the palace and the good clothes they wore.
she saw his parties and the sacrifices that he offered in the lord’s temple.
she was so amazed, she could hardly breathe!
then she said to king solomon, “the stories i heard in my country about your great works and your wisdom are true.
i did not believe it until i came and saw it with my own eyes.
now i see that it is even greater than what i heard.
your wealth and wisdom are much greater than people told me.
your wives and officers are very fortunate, because they serve you and hear your wisdom every day.
praise the lord your god!
he was pleased to make you king of israel.
because of the lord’s unending love for israel, he has made you king to rule with justice and fairness.” 
then the queen of sheba gave king solomon 4 1/2 tons of gold, a huge amount of spices, and precious stones.
she gave him more spices than anyone has ever brought into israel.
hiram’s ships brought gold from ophir.
they also brought jewels and a special kind of wood.
solomon used this special wood to build supports in the temple and the palace as well as harps and lyres for the singers.
that was the last time such a large shipment of that kind of wood was brought to israel.
there hasn’t been any seen around here since then.
king solomon gave the queen of sheba everything she asked for.
he gave her more than she brought to give him.
then the queen of sheba and her servants left and went back to their own country.
every year king solomon received almost 25 tons of gold.
in addition to the gold brought in by the traveling merchants and traders, all the kings of arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver to solomon.
king solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold.
he used about 15 pounds of gold for each shield.
he also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold.
he used almost 4 pounds of gold for each shield.
the king put them in the forest-of-lebanon house.
king solomon also built a large throne with ivory decorations.
it was covered with pure gold.
there were six steps leading up to the throne.
the back of the throne was round at the top.
there were armrests on both sides of the throne, and there were lions in the sides of the throne under the armrests.
there were also two lions on each of the six steps, one at each end.
there was nothing like it in any other kingdom.
all of solomon’s cups and glasses were made of gold, and all the dishes in the building called the forest of lebanon were made from pure gold.
nothing in the palace was made from silver.
there was so much gold that in solomon’s time people did not think silver was important.
the king also had many cargo ships that he sent out to trade things with other countries.
these were hiram’s ships.
every three years the ships would come back with a new load of gold, silver, ivory, and apes and baboons.
king solomon became greater in riches and wisdom than any other king on earth.
people everywhere wanted to see king solomon and listen to the great wisdom that god had given him.
every year people came to see the king and brought gifts made from gold and silver, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
solomon had a great number of chariots and horses.
he had 1400 chariots and 12,000 horse soldiers.
he built special cities for these chariots.
so the chariots were kept in these cities.
king solomon also kept some of the chariots with him in jerusalem.
the king made israel very rich.
in the city of jerusalem, silver was as common as rocks and cedar wood was as common as the many fig trees growing on the hills.
solomon brought horses from egypt and kue.
his traders bought them in kue and brought them to israel.
a chariot from egypt cost about 15 pounds of silver, and a horse cost almost 4 pounds of silver.
solomon sold horses and chariots to the kings of the hittites and the arameans.
chapter 45.
joseph could not control himself any longer.
he cried in front of all the people who were there.
joseph said, “tell everyone to leave here.” so all the people left.
only the brothers were left with joseph.
then he told them who he was.
joseph continued to cry, and all the egyptian people in pharaoh’s house heard it.
he said to his brothers, “i am your brother joseph.
is my father doing well?” but the brothers did not answer him because they were confused and afraid.
so joseph said to his brothers again, “come here to me.
i beg you, come here.” when the brothers went to him, he said to them, “i am your brother joseph.
i am the one you sold as a slave to egypt.
now don’t be worried.
don’t be angry with yourselves for what you did.
it was god’s plan for me to come here.
i am here to save people’s lives.
this terrible famine has continued for two years now, and there will be five more years without planting or harvest.
so god sent me here ahead of you so that i can save your people in this country.
it was not your fault that i was sent here.
it was god’s plan.
god made me like a father to pharaoh.
i am the governor over all his house and over all egypt.” 
joseph said, “hurry up and go to my father.
tell him his son joseph sent this message: ‘god made me the governor of egypt.
so come here to me quickly.
don’t wait.
you can live near me in the land of goshen.
you, your children, your grandchildren, and all of your animals are welcome here.
i will take care of you during the next five years of hunger.
so you and your family will not lose everything you own.’ 
“surely you can see that i really am joseph.
even my brother benjamin knows it is me, your brother, talking to you.
so tell my father about the honor i have received here in egypt.
tell him about everything you have seen here.
now hurry, go bring my father back to me.” 
then joseph hugged his brother benjamin, and they both began crying.
then joseph cried as he kissed all his brothers.
after this, the brothers began talking with him.
pharaoh learned that joseph’s brothers had come to him.
this news spread throughout pharaoh’s house.
pharaoh and his servants were very excited!
so pharaoh told joseph, “tell your brothers to take all the food they need and go back to the land of canaan.
tell them to bring your father and their families back here to me.
i will give you the best land in egypt to live on.
and your family can eat the best food we have here.
also give your brothers some of our best wagons.
tell them to go to canaan and bring your father and all the women and children back in the wagons.
don’t worry about bringing all of their belongings.
we can give them the best of egypt.” 
so the sons of israel did this.
joseph gave them good wagons just as pharaoh had promised.
and joseph gave them enough food for their trip.
he gave each brother a suit of beautiful clothes.
but to benjamin he gave five suits of beautiful clothes and 300 pieces of silver.
joseph also sent gifts to his father.
he sent ten donkeys with bags full of many good things from egypt.
and he sent ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other food for his father on his trip back.
then joseph told his brothers to go.
while they were leaving, he said to them, “go straight home, and don’t fight on the way.” 
so the brothers left egypt and went to their father in the land of canaan.
they told him, “father, joseph is still alive!
and he is the governor over the whole country of egypt.” their father did not know what to think.
at first he didn’t believe them.
but then they told him everything joseph had said.
then their father saw the wagons that joseph had sent to bring him back to egypt, and he became excited and very happy.
israel said, “now i believe you.
my son joseph is still alive!
i am going to see him before i die!”

chapter 1.
king david was very old and could not keep warm.
his servants covered him with blankets, but he was still cold.
so they said to him, “we will find a young woman to care for you.
she will lie next to you and keep you warm.” 
so the king’s servants began looking everywhere in the country of israel for a beautiful young woman to keep the king warm.
they found a young woman named abishag, from the town of shunem, and brought her to the king.
she was very beautiful.
she cared for the king and served him, but king david did not have sexual relations with her.
adonijah was the son of king david and his wife haggith.
he was born after absalom.
adonijah was a very handsome man.
king david never corrected his son adonijah, and he never made him explain his actions.
adonijah became very proud and decided that he would be the next king.
he wanted very much to be the king, so he got himself a chariot, horses, and 50 men to run ahead of him.
adonijah talked with joab son of zeruiah and abiathar the priest.
they decided to help make him the new king, 
but several important men did not join adonijah.
they were zadok the priest, benaiah son of jehoiada, nathan the prophet, shimei, rei, and king david’s special guard.
one day, at zoheleth rock near en rogel, adonijah sacrificed some sheep, cattle, and fat calves as a fellowship offering.
he invited his brothers (the other sons of king david) and all the officers from judah.
but he did not invite his brother solomon, nathan the prophet, benaiah, or the men in the king’s special guard.
when nathan heard about this, he went to solomon’s mother bathsheba and asked her, “have you heard what haggith’s son, adonijah, is doing?
he is making himself king.
and our master, king david, knows nothing about it.
you and your son solomon are in danger, but i will tell you what to do to save yourself.
go to king david and tell him, ‘my lord and king, you promised me that my son solomon would be the next king after you.
so why is adonijah becoming the new king?’ 
then while you are still talking with him, i will come in.
after you leave i will tell the king what has happened.
this will show that what you said is true.” 
so bathsheba went in to see the king in his bedroom.
the king was very old.
abishag, the girl from shunem, was caring for him there.
bathsheba bowed down before the king.
the king asked, “what can i do for you?” 
bathsheba answered, “sir, you used the name of the lord your god and made a promise to me.
you said, ‘your son solomon will be the next king after me.
he will sit on my throne.’ 
now, you don’t know this, but adonijah is making himself king.
he is giving a big fellowship meal.
he has killed many cattle and the best sheep, and he has invited all of your sons to the meal.
he also invited abiathar the priest and joab, the commander of your army, but he did not invite your faithful son solomon.
now, my lord and king, all the israelites are watching you.
they are waiting for you to decide who will be the next king after you.
if you don’t decide, then after you are buried, these men will say that solomon and i are criminals.” 
while bathsheba was still talking with the king, nathan the prophet came to see him.
the servants told the king, “nathan the prophet is here.” nathan went in to speak to the king.
he bowed down before the king 
and said, “my lord and king, did you announce that adonijah will be the new king after you?
have you decided that he will rule the people now?
today he went down into the valley to offer many cattle and the best sheep as fellowship offerings.
he invited all your other sons, the commanders of the army, and abiathar the priest.
they are now eating and drinking with him.
and they are saying, ‘long live king adonijah!’ 
but he did not invite me, or zadok the priest, or benaiah son of jehoiada, or your son solomon.
my lord and king, did you do this without telling us?
please tell us, who will be the next king after you?” 
then king david said, “tell bathsheba to come in!” so she came in and stood before the king.
then the king made a promise: “the lord has saved me from every danger.
as surely as he lives, i make this promise to you.
today i will do what i promised you in the past.
i made that promise by the power of the lord, the god of israel.
i promised that your son solomon would be the next king after me.
i promised that he would take my place on my throne, and i will keep my promise!” 
then bathsheba bowed down before the king and said, “long live king david!” 
then king david said, “tell zadok the priest, nathan the prophet, and benaiah son of jehoiada to come in here.” so the three men came in to meet with the king.
then the king said to them, “take my officers with you.
put my son solomon on my mule and take him to gihon spring.
there zadok the priest and nathan the prophet will anoint him to be the new king of israel.
blow the trumpet and announce, ‘this is the new king, solomon!’ 
then come back here with him.
solomon will sit on my throne and be the new king in my place.
i have chosen him to be the ruler of israel and judah.” 
benaiah son of jehoiada answered the king, “amen!
it is as true as if the lord god himself had said it, my lord and king.
my lord and king, the lord has been with you, and now i pray that he will be with solomon!
and i pray that king solomon’s kingdom will grow and be even more powerful than yours, my lord and king.” 
so zadok, nathan, benaiah, and the king’s officers obeyed king david.
they put solomon on david’s mule and went with him down to gihon spring.
zadok the priest carried the oil from the holy tent and poured it on solomon’s head to show that he was the new king.
they blew the trumpet and all the people shouted, “long live king solomon!” 
then all the people followed solomon back into the city.
they were very happy and excited.
they were playing flutes and making so much noise that the ground shook.
meanwhile, adonijah and his guests were just finishing their meal.
they heard the sound of the trumpet, and joab asked, “what is that noise?
what is happening in the city?” 
while joab was still speaking, jonathan, son of abiathar the priest, arrived.
adonijah said, “come here!
you are a good man, so you must be bringing good news.” 
but jonathan answered, “no, it is not good news for you!
king david has made solomon the new king.
king david sent zadok the priest, nathan the prophet, benaiah son of jehoiada, and all the king’s officers with solomon out to gihon spring.
they put solomon on the king’s mule.
zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anointed solomon at gihon spring and then went back into the city.
the people followed them, and now everyone in the city is celebrating.
that is the noise you hear.
solomon is sitting on the king’s throne and the king’s officers are congratulating king david, saying, ‘king david, you are a great king!’ and now we pray that your god will make solomon a great king too.
we pray your god will make him even more famous than you.
and we pray that his kingdom will be even greater than yours is!
even king david was there.
from his bed, the king bowed before solomon 
and said, ‘praise the lord, the god of israel.
he has put one of my own sons on my throne, and he has let me live to see it.’” 
all of adonijah’s guests were afraid and left very quickly.
adonijah was also afraid of solomon, so he went to the altar and held onto the horns of the altar.
then someone told solomon, “adonijah is afraid of you, king solomon.
he is at the holy tent holding onto the horns of the altar, and he refuses to leave.
adonijah says, ‘tell king solomon to promise that he will not kill me.’” 
so solomon answered, “if adonijah shows that he is a good man, i promise that not a hair on his head will be hurt.
but if he does anything wrong, he will die.” 
then king solomon sent some men to get adonijah and brought him in.
he approached the king and bowed before him.
then solomon said, “go home.”

chapter 6.
to the director: with stringed instruments, on the sheminith.
a song of david.
lord, don’t punish me.
don’t correct me when you are so angry.
lord, be kind to me.
i am sick and weak.
heal me, lord!
my bones are shaking.
i am trembling all over.
lord, how long until you heal me?
lord, come back and make me strong again.
save me because you are so loyal and kind.
if i am dead, i cannot sing about you.
those in the grave don’t praise you.
lord, i am so weak.
i cried to you all night.
my pillow is soaked; my bed is dripping wet from my tears.
my enemies have caused me such sorrow that my eyes are worn out from crying.
go away, you wicked people, because the lord has heard my cries.
the lord has heard my request for mercy.
the lord has accepted my prayer.
all my enemies will be filled with fear and shame.
they will be sorry when disgrace suddenly comes upon them.
chapter 83.
one of asaph’s songs of praise.
god, don’t keep quiet!
don’t close your ears!
please say something, god.
your enemies are getting ready to do something.
those who hate you will soon attack.
they are making secret plans against your people.
your enemies are discussing plans against the people you love.
they say, “come, let us destroy them completely.
then no one will ever again remember the name israel.” 
god, they have all joined together.
they have united against you.
their army includes the edomites, ishmaelites, moabites, and hagar’s descendants, the people of byblos, ammon, and amalek, the philistines, and the people of tyre.
even the assyrians have joined them.
they have made lot’s descendants very powerful.
selah 
god, defeat them just as you defeated midian.
do what you did to sisera and jabin at the kishon river.
you destroyed the enemy at endor, and their bodies rotted on the ground.
punish their leaders as you did oreb and zeeb.
do what you did to zebah and zalmunna.
they said, “let’s make this land our own— these fields of grass that belong to god!” 
make them like weeds blown by the wind.
scatter them the way wind scatters straw.
be like a fire that destroys a forest or like a flame that sets the hills on fire.
chase them away with your blasts of wind; frighten them with your storms.
lord, cover them with shame until they come to you for help.
may they be forever ashamed and afraid.
disgrace and defeat them.
then they will know that your name is yahweh— that you alone are the lord.
they will know that you are god most high, ruler over all the earth!
chapter 4.
eliphaz from teman answered: 
“i must say something.
would it upset you if i speak?
job, you have taught many people.
you encouraged those who were ready to quit.
your words helped those who were ready to fall.
you gave strength to those who could not stand by themselves.
but now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged.
trouble hits you, and you are upset.
you worship god.
you trust him.
you are a good man, so let that be your hope.
can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed?
do you know of any place where good people are punished?
yes, i have seen people whose lives were cut short, but they were evil troublemakers.
they lost the breath god gave them.
they were cut off from his breath of life.
they were like roaring lions, like growling lions with broken teeth— 
like a lioness that cannot find prey.
they died, and their cubs starved to death.
“i happened to hear a message.
my ears caught a whisper of it.
like a bad dream in the night, it ruined my sleep.
it frightened me, and i trembled down to my bones.
a spirit passed by my face.
the hair on my body stood up!
the spirit stood still, but i could not see what it was.
a shape stood before my eyes, and there was silence.
then i heard a quiet voice: 
‘a person cannot be more right than god.
people cannot be more pure than their maker.
look, god cannot even trust his heavenly servants.
he sees faults even in his angels.
so surely people are worse!
they live in houses of clay built on dust.
they can be crushed as easily as a moth!
from dawn to sunset people are destroyed.
they die—gone forever—and no one even notices.
the ropes of their tent are pulled up, and they die before gaining wisdom.’ 
song of songs.
chapter 6.
beautiful woman, where has your lover gone?
which way did your lover go?
tell us so that we can help you look for him.
my lover has gone down to his garden, where sweet-smelling spices grow.
there, like a sheep, he will eat the grass, and he will enjoy the lilies.
i belong to my lover, and my lover belongs to me.
he is the one feeding among the lilies.
my darling, you are as beautiful as tirzah, as pleasant as jerusalem, as awesome as the stars in the sky.
don’t look at me!
your eyes excite me too much!
and your hair is long and flowing, like little goats dancing down the slopes of mount gilead.
your teeth are white like ewes just coming from their bath.
they all give birth to twins.
not one of them has lost a baby.
your cheeks under your veil are like slices of pomegranate.
there might be 60 queens and 80 slave women, and young women too many to count, 
but there is only one woman for me, my dove, my perfect one.
she is the favorite of her mother, her mother’s favorite child.
the young women see her and praise her.
even the queens and slave women praise her.
who is that young woman?
she shines out like the dawn.
she is as pretty as the moon.
she is as bright as the sun.
she is as awesome as the stars in the sky.
i went down to the grove of walnut trees, to see the fruit of the valley, to see if the vines were in bloom, to see if the pomegranates had budded.
i was so excited when she put me in the royal chariot.
come back, come back, shulamith!
come back, come back, so we may look at you.
why are you staring at shulamith, as she dances the mahanaim dance?
2 chronicles.
chapter 16.
in asa’s 36th year as king, baasha attacked judah and then built up the city of ramah to keep asa from leaving judah on any kind of military campaign.
so asa took gold and silver from the treasuries of the lord’s temple and the king’s palace.
he gave it to his officials and sent them to king ben-hadad of aram.
ben-hadad was the son of tabrimmon.
tabrimmon was the son of hezion.
damascus was ben-hadad’s capital city.
asa sent this message: “my father and your father had a peace agreement.
now i want to make a peace agreement with you.
i am sending you this gift of gold and silver.
please break your treaty with king baasha of israel and make him leave us alone.” 
king ben-hadad made that agreement with king asa and sent his army to fight against the israelite towns of ijon, dan, abel maim, and the storage cities in the area of naphtali.
when baasha heard about these attacks, he stopped building up ramah and went back to tirzah.
he stopped all the work he was doing.
then king asa gave an order for all the men in judah, with no exceptions.
they had to go to ramah and carry out all the stone and wood that baasha was using to build up the city.
they carried the material to geba in benjamin and to mizpah and used it to strengthen those two cities.
at that time hanani the seer came to king asa of judah and said to him, “asa, you depended on the king of aram to help you and not the lord your god.
that’s why the king’s army has escaped from you.
did you forget what happened with the ethiopians and the libyans who also had a powerful army with many chariots and horse soldiers?
that time you depended on the lord to help you, and he let you defeat them.
the eyes of the lord go around looking in all the earth for people who are faithful to him so that he can make them strong.
asa, you did a foolish thing.
so from now on you will have wars.” 
asa was angry with hanani because of what he said.
he was so mad that he put hanani in prison.
he was also very rough and cruel to some of the people then.
everything asa did, from the beginning to the end, is written in the book, the history of the kings of judah and israel.
asa’s feet became infected in his 39th year as king.
even though the infection was very serious, asa did not go to the lord for help.
he went to the doctors instead.
asa died in the 41st year as king and rested with his ancestors.
the people buried asa in his own tomb that he made for himself in the city of david.
they laid him in a bed that was filled with spices and different kinds of mixed perfumes, and they burned a large fire for him.
chapter 42.
to the director: a maskil from the korah family.
like a deer drinking from a stream, i reach out to you, my god.
my soul thirsts for the living god.
when can i go to meet with him?
instead of food, i have only tears day and night, as my enemies laugh at me and say, “where is your god?” 
my heart breaks as i remember the pleasant times in the past, when i walked with the crowds as i led them up to god’s temple.
i remember the happy songs of praise as they celebrated the festival.
why am i so sad?
why am i so upset?
i tell myself, “wait for god’s help!
you will again be able to praise him, your god, the one who will save you.” in my sadness i say, “i will remember you from here on this small hill, where mount hermon and the jordan river meet.” 
i hear the roar of the water coming from deep within the earth.
it shouts to the water below as it tumbles down the waterfall.
god, your waves come one after another, crashing all around and over me.
by day the lord shows his faithful love, and at night i have a song for him—a prayer for the god of my life.
i say to god, my rock, “why have you forgotten me?
why must i suffer this sadness that my enemies have brought me?” 
their constant insults are killing me.
they never stop asking, “where is your god?” 
why am i so sad?
why am i so upset?
i tell myself, “wait for god’s help!
you will again be able to praise him, your god, the one who will save you.” 
joshua.
chapter 22.
then joshua called a meeting of all the people from the tribes of reuben, gad, and half the tribe of manasseh.
joshua said to them, “moses was the lord’s servant.
you obeyed everything that moses told you to do.
and you also obeyed all of my commands.
all this time you have supported all the other israelites.
you carefully obeyed all the commands that the lord your god gave you.
the lord your god promised to give the israelites peace.
and now, he has kept his promise, so now you can go home.
the lord’s servant moses gave you the land on the east side of the jordan river.
now you can go home to that land.
but remember—continue to obey the law that the lord’s servant moses gave you.
you must love the lord your god and obey his commands.
you must continue to follow him and serve him the very best that you can.” 
then joshua said goodbye to them, and they left and went home.
moses had given the land of bashan to half of the manasseh tribe.
joshua gave land on the west side of the jordan river to the other half of the manasseh tribe.
joshua blessed them and sent them home.
he said, “you have become very rich.
you have many animals.
you have gold, silver, and expensive jewelry.
you have many beautiful clothes.
you have taken many things from your enemies.
go home and divide these things among yourselves.” 
so the people from the tribes of reuben, gad, and manasseh left the other israelites at shiloh in canaan.
they went back home to gilead.
this was their own land, the land that moses gave them, as the lord had commanded.
they went to the place called geliloth, near the jordan river in the land of canaan.
there they built a beautiful altar.
but the other israelites who were still at shiloh heard about the altar that these three tribes built.
they heard that the altar was at the border of canaan at the place called geliloth.
it was near the jordan river on israel’s side.
all the israelites became very angry with these three tribes.
they met together and decided to fight against them.
so the israelites sent some men to talk to the people of reuben, gad, and manasseh.
the leader of these men was phinehas, son of eleazar the priest.
they also sent ten of the leaders of the tribes there.
there was one man from each family group of israel who was at shiloh.
so these eleven men went to gilead.
they went to talk to the people of reuben, gad, and manasseh.
the eleven men said to them, 
“all the lord’s people sent us to ask you this: ‘why did you do this thing against the god of israel?
why did you stop following the lord?
why did you build an altar for yourselves?
you know that this is against the lord’s command.
remember what happened at peor?
was the sin we committed there not bad enough?
because of that sin, the lord punished his people with a terrible sickness.
and we are still suffering from that sin.
and now you are doing the same thing.
you are turning against the lord.
will you refuse to follow the lord?
if you don’t stop what you are doing, he will be angry with everyone in israel.
“‘if your land is not a good place to worship god, come over to the lord’s land.
this is where the lord’s tent is.
you can have some of the land and live here.
but don’t turn against the lord or against us by building another altar.
we already have the altar of the lord our god at the meeting tent.
“‘remember how achan son of zerah refused to obey the command about things that must be destroyed.
that one man broke god’s law, but all the israelites were punished.
achan died because of his sin, but also many other people died.’” 
the people from the tribes of reuben, gad, and manasseh answered the eleven men.
they said, 
“the lord is our god!
again we say that the lord is our god!
and god knows why we did this thing.
we want you to know also.
you can judge what we did.
if you think we did it because we are against the lord or refuse to obey him, you can kill us today.
do you think we built our own altar because we want to turn away from the lord?
do you think we built another altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, and fellowship offerings?
if that is why we built this altar, we ask the lord himself to punish us.
but that is not why we built it.
we built it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants might not accept us as part of god’s people.
so your children might say to our children, ‘you people have no reason to worship the lord, the god of israel.
the lord separated you people of reuben and gad from us by giving you the land on the other side of the jordan river.
so you are not part of the lord’s people.’ if your children said that, it might make our children stop worshiping the lord.
“so we decided to build this altar.
but we did not plan to use it for burning offerings and sacrifices.
the real reason we wanted our altar was to show our people that we worship the same god you do.
this altar will be the proof to you and us and to all our future children that we worship the lord.
we give our sacrifices, grain offerings, and fellowship offerings to the lord.
we wanted your children to grow up and know that we are also israelites like yourselves.
in the future, if it happens that your children say that we don’t belong to israel, then our children can say, ‘look, our fathers who lived before us made an altar.
that altar is exactly like the lord’s altar at the holy tent.
we don’t use this altar for sacrifices—this altar is proof that we are part of israel.’ 
“the truth is, we don’t want to be against the lord.
we don’t want to stop following him now.
we know that the only true altar is the one that is in front of the holy tent.
that altar belongs to the lord our god.” 
phinehas the priest and the leaders with him heard what the people from reuben, gad, and manasseh said.
they were satisfied that they were telling the truth.
so phinehas the priest said, “now we know that the lord is with us and that you did not turn against him.
we are happy that the israelites will not be punished by the lord.” 
then phinehas and the leaders left that place and went home.
they left the people of reuben and gad in the land of gilead and went back to canaan.
they went back to the israelites and told them what had happened.
the israelites were also satisfied.
they were happy and thanked god.
they decided not to go and fight against the people of reuben, gad, and manasseh.
they decided not to destroy the land where those people live.
the people of reuben and gad named the altar “proof that we believe the lord is god.” 
jeremiah.
chapter 14.
this is the lord’s message to jeremiah about the drought: 
“the nation of judah cries for people who have died.
the people in the cities of judah grow weaker and weaker.
they lie on the ground.
people in jerusalem, cry to god for help.
the leaders of the people send their servants to get water.
the servants go to the water storage places, but they don’t find any water.
the servants come back with empty jars, so they are ashamed and embarrassed.
they cover their heads from shame.
no one prepares the ground for crops.
no rain falls on the land.
the farmers are depressed.
so they cover their heads from shame.
even the mother deer in the field leaves her newborn baby alone, because there is no grass.
wild donkeys stand on the bare hills.
they sniff the wind like jackals.
but their eyes cannot find any food, because there are no plants to eat.
“we know that this is our fault.
we are now suffering because of our sins.
lord, do something to help us for the good of your name.
we admit that we have left you many times.
we have sinned against you.
god, you are the hope of israel!
you save israel in times of trouble.
but now it seems like you are a stranger in the land, like a traveler who only stays one night.
you seem like a man who has been attacked by surprise, like a soldier who does not have the power to save anyone.
but, lord, you are with us.
we are called by your name, so don’t leave us without help!” 
this is what the lord says about the people of judah: “the people of judah really love to leave me.
they don’t stop themselves from leaving me.
so now the lord will not accept them.
now he will remember the evil they do.
he will punish them for their sins.” 
then the lord said to me, “jeremiah, don’t pray for good things to happen to the people of judah.
they might begin to fast and pray to me, but i will not listen to their prayers.
even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings to me, i will not accept them.
i will destroy the people of judah with war.
i will take away their food, and they will starve.
and i will destroy them with terrible diseases.” 
but i said, “lord god, the prophets were telling the people something different.
they were telling the people of judah, ‘you will not suffer from war or from hunger.
the lord will give you peace in this land.’” 
then the lord said to me, “jeremiah, those prophets are telling lies in my name.
i did not send them or command them or speak to them.
their prophecies came from false visions, worthless magic, and their own wishful thinking.
so this is what i, the lord, say about the prophets who are speaking in my name.
i did not send them.
they said, ‘no enemy will ever attack this country.
there will never be hunger in this land.’ so those prophets will die from hunger or by an enemy’s sword.
and the people they spoke to will be thrown into the streets.
the people will die from hunger and war.
i will punish them, and no one will be there to bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters.
“jeremiah, speak this message to the people of judah: ‘my eyes fill with tears night and day without stopping.
i cry for my virgin daughter, and for my dear people, because someone hit them and crushed them.
they have been hurt very badly.
if i go into the country, i see the bodies of those killed in war.
if i go into the city, i see people sick from hunger.
the priests and prophets continue their work, but they don’t understand what is happening.’” 
lord, have you completely rejected the nation of judah?
do you hate zion?
you hurt us so badly that we cannot be made well again.
why did you do that?
we were hoping for peace, but nothing good has come.
we were hoping for a time of healing, but only terror came.
lord, we know that we are wicked.
we know that our ancestors did evil things.
yes, we sinned against you.
for the good of your name, don’t push us away.
don’t take away the honor from your glorious throne.
remember your agreement with us and do not break it.
foreign idols don’t have the power to bring rain.
the sky does not have the power to send down showers of rain.
you, the lord our god, are our only hope.
you are the one who made all these things.
chapter 3.
“we turned and went on the road to bashan.
king og of bashan and all his men came out to fight against us at edrei.
the lord said to me, ‘don’t be afraid of og.
i have decided to give him to you.
i will give you all his men and his land.
you will defeat him just as you defeated sihon, the amorite king who ruled in heshbon.’ 
“so the lord our god let us defeat king og of bashan.
we destroyed him and all his men.
not one of them was left.
then we took all the cities that belonged to og at that time.
we took all the cities from og’s people—60 cities in the area of argob, og’s kingdom in bashan.
all these cities were very strong.
they had high walls, gates, and strong bars on the gates.
there were also many towns that did not have walls.
we destroyed them just as we destroyed the cities of king sihon of heshbon.
we completely destroyed every city and all the people in them, even the women and the babies.
but we kept all the cattle and the valuable things from the cities for ourselves.
“in that way we took the land from the two amorite kings.
we took that land on the east side of the jordan river, from arnon valley to mount hermon.
(the people from sidon call mount hermon, sirion, but the amorites called it senir.)
we took all the cities in the high plain and all of gilead.
we took all of bashan, all the way to salecah and edrei.
salecah and edrei were cities of og’s kingdom of bashan.” 
(og was the king of bashan.
he was one of the few rephaites still alive.
his bed was made from iron, and it was over 13 feet long and 6 feet wide.
the bed is still in the city of rabbah, where the ammonites live.)
“so we took that land to be ours.
i gave part of this land to the tribes of reuben and gad.
i gave them the land from aroer in the arnon valley to the hill country of gilead with the cities in it.
they got half of the hill country of gilead.
i gave the other half of gilead and the whole area of bashan to half the tribe of manasseh.” (bashan was og’s kingdom.
part of bashan was called argob.
it was also called the land of rephaim.
jair, from the tribe of manasseh, took the whole area of argob.
that area went all the way to the border of the geshurites and the maacathites.
it was named for jair, and even today, people call bashan the towns of jair.)
“i gave gilead to makir.
and to the tribe of reuben and the tribe of gad, i gave the land that begins at gilead and goes from the arnon valley to the jabbok river.
the middle of the valley is one border.
the jabbok river is the border for the ammonites.
the jordan river near the desert is their western border.
lake galilee is north of this area and the dead sea is to the south.
it is at the bottom of the cliffs of pisgah, which are to the east.
“at that time i gave those tribes this command: ‘the lord your god has given you the land on this side of the jordan river to live in.
but now your fighting men must take their weapons and lead the other israelite tribes across the river.
your wives, your little children, and your cattle (i know you have many cattle) will stay here in the cities i have given you.
but you must help your israelite relatives until they take the land that the lord is giving them on the other side of the jordan river.
help them until the lord gives them peace there, just as he did for you here.
then you may come back to this land that i have given you.’ 
“then i told joshua, ‘you have seen all that the lord your god has done to these two kings.
the lord will do the same thing to all the kingdoms you will enter.
don’t fear the kings of these lands, because the lord your god will fight for you.’ 
“then i begged the lord to do something special for me.
i said, 
‘lord god, i am your servant.
i know that you have shown me only a small part of the wonderful and powerful things you will do.
there is no god in heaven or earth that can do the great and powerful things you have done.
please let me go across the jordan river and see the good land on the other side.
let me see the beautiful hill country and lebanon.’ 
“but the lord was angry with me because of you and refused to listen to me.
the lord said to me, ‘that’s enough!
don’t say another word about this.
go up to the top of mount pisgah.
look to the west, to the north, to the south, and to the east.
you may see these things with your eyes, but you can never go across the jordan river.
you must give instructions to joshua.
encourage him.
make him strong, because joshua must lead the people across the jordan river.
you can see the land, but joshua will lead them into that land.
he will help them take the land and live in it.’ 
“so we stayed in the valley across from beth peor.
chapter 29.
the lord made an agreement with the israelites at mount horeb.
in addition to that agreement, he also commanded moses to make another agreement with them while they were in moab.
this is that agreement.
moses called together all the israelites.
he said to them, “you saw everything the lord did in the land of egypt.
you saw what he did to pharaoh, to pharaoh’s officers, and to his whole country.
you saw the great troubles he gave them.
you saw the miracles and amazing things he did.
but even today, you still don’t understand what happened.
the lord has not let you really understand what you saw and heard.
he led you through the desert for 40 years, and in all that time, your clothes and sandals did not wear out.
you did not have any food with you.
you did not have any wine or anything else to drink.
but he took care of you so that you would understand that he is the lord your god.
“you came to this place, and king sihon of heshbon and king og of bashan came out to fight against us.
but we defeated them.
then we took their land and gave it to the people in the tribes of reuben and gad and to half the tribe of manasseh.
if you obey all the commands in this agreement, you will continue to succeed in everything you do.
“today all of you are standing here before the lord your god.
your leaders, your officials, your elders, and all the other men are here.
your wives and children are here and also the foreigners living among you—the people who cut your wood and bring you water.
you are all here to enter into an agreement with the lord your god.
the lord your god is making this agreement with you today.
with this agreement he is making you his own special people, and he himself will become your god.
he told you this.
he promised this to your ancestors—abraham, isaac, and jacob.
the lord is making this agreement with its promises with you people, but not only with you.
yes, he is making this agreement with all of you who stand here with us today before the lord our god.
but this agreement is also for our descendants who are not here with us today.
you remember how we lived in the land of egypt.
and you remember how we traveled through the countries that were on our way here.
you saw their hated things—the idols they had made from wood, stone, silver, and gold.
be sure that there is no man, woman, family or tribe here today who turns away from the lord our god.
no one should go and serve the gods of the other nations.
people who do that are like a plant that grows bitter and poisonous fruit.
“some people might hear these curses and comfort themselves by saying, ‘i will continue doing what i want.
nothing bad will happen to me.’ but that attitude will bring total disaster.
the lord will not forgive them for that.
no, the lord will be angry and upset with them and punish them.
the lord will separate them from the tribes of israel.
he will completely destroy them.
all the curses that are written in this book will happen to them.
they are a part of the agreement that is written in this book of teachings.
“in the future, your descendants and foreigners from faraway countries will see how the land has been ruined.
they will see the diseases that the lord has brought to it.
all the land will be useless—destroyed by burning sulfur and covered with salt.
the land will have nothing planted in it.
nothing will be growing—not even weeds.
the land will be destroyed like sodom, gomorrah, admah, and zeboiim, the cities the lord destroyed when he was very angry.
“all the other nations will ask, ‘why did the lord do this to this land?
why was he so angry?’ 
the answer will be, ‘this happened because the israelites left the agreement of the lord, the god of their ancestors.
they stopped following the agreement he made with them when he brought them out of egypt.
the israelites started serving other gods—gods they never worshiped before.
the lord told his people not to worship those gods.
that is why the lord became very angry with the people of this land.
so he brought to them all the curses that are written in this book.
the lord became very angry and upset with them.
so he took them out of their land.
he put them in another land, where they are today.’ 
“there are some things that the lord our god has kept secret.
only he knows these things.
but he told us about some things.
and these teachings are for us and our descendants forever.
and we must obey all the commands in that law.

chapter 21.
then david left and jonathan went back to the town.
david went to the town named nob to see ahimelech the priest.
ahimelech went out to meet david.
he was afraid of david and asked, “why are you alone?
why isn’t anyone with you?” 
david answered him, “the king gave me a special order.
he told me, ‘don’t let anyone know about this mission.
no one must know what i told you to do.’ i told my men where to meet me.
now, what food do you have with you?
give me five loaves of bread or whatever you have to eat.” 
the priest said to david, “i don’t have any ordinary bread here, but i do have some of the holy bread.
your officers can eat it if they have not had sexual relations with any women.” 
david answered the priest, “we have not been with any women.
my men keep their bodies holy every time we go out to fight, even on ordinary missions.
and this is especially true today.” 
there was no bread except the holy bread, so the priest gave david this bread.
this was the bread that the priests put on the holy table before the lord.
each day they took this bread away and put fresh bread in its place.
one of saul’s officers was there that day.
he was doeg the edomite, the leader of saul’s shepherds.
he had been kept there before the lord.
david asked ahimelech, “do you have a spear or sword here?
the king’s business is very important.
i had to leave quickly, and i didn’t bring my sword or any other weapon.” 
the priest answered, “the only sword here is the sword of goliath the philistine.
it is the sword you took from him when you killed him in the valley of elah.
that sword is behind the ephod, wrapped in a cloth.
you may take it if you want to.” david said, “goliath’s sword—there’s not another one like it.
give it to me.” 
that day david ran away from saul and went to king achish of gath.
achish’s officers said, “isn’t this david, the king of the land of israel?
he is the one the israelites sing about.
they dance and sing this song about him: “saul has killed thousands of enemies, but david has killed tens of thousands.” 
david paid close attention to what they said.
he was afraid of king achish of gath, 
so he pretended to be crazy in front of achish and his officers.
while david was with them, he acted like a crazy man.
he spat on the doors of the gate.
he let spit fall down his beard.
achish said to his officers, “look at the man!
he is crazy.
why did you bring him to me?
i have enough crazy men.
i don’t need you to bring this man to my house to act crazy in front of me.
don’t let this man come into my house again.” 
genesis.
chapter 41.
two years later pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the nile river.
in the dream, seven cows came out of the river and stood there eating grass.
they were healthy, good-looking cows.
then seven more cows came out of the river and stood on the bank of the river by the healthy cows.
but these cows were thin and looked sick.
the seven sick cows ate the seven healthy cows.
then pharaoh woke up.
pharaoh went back to sleep and began dreaming again.
this time he dreamed that he saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant.
they were healthy and full of grain.
then he saw seven more heads of grain sprouting, but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind.
the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain.
then pharaoh woke up again and realized it was only a dream.
the next morning pharaoh was worried about these dreams, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of egypt.
pharaoh told these men the dreams, but none of them could explain the dreams.
then the wine servant remembered joseph and said to pharaoh, “i remember something that happened to me.
you were angry with the baker and me, and you put us in prison.
then one night he and i had a dream.
each dream had a different meaning.
there was a young hebrew man in prison with us.
he was a servant of the commander of the guards.
we told him our dreams, and he explained them to us.
he told us the meaning of each dream, 
and what he said came true.
he said i would be free and have my old job back, and it happened.
he also said the baker would die, and it happened!” 
so pharaoh called joseph from the prison.
the guards quickly got joseph out of prison.
joseph shaved, put on some clean clothes, and went to see pharaoh.
pharaoh said to joseph, “i had a dream, and no one can explain it for me.
i heard that you can explain dreams when someone tells you about them.” 
joseph answered, “i cannot!
but god can explain the dream for you, pharaoh.” 
then pharaoh said to joseph, “in my dream i was standing by the nile river.
seven cows came up out of the river and stood there eating the grass.
they were healthy, good-looking cows.
then i saw seven more cows come up out of the river after them, but these cows were thin and looked sick.
they were the worst cows i had ever seen anywhere in egypt!
the thin, sick cows ate the first healthy cows, 
but they still looked thin and sick.
you couldn’t even tell they had eaten the healthy cows.
they looked as thin and sick as they did in the beginning.
then i woke up.
“in my next dream i saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant.
they were healthy and full of grain.
and then seven more heads of grain grew after them, but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind.
then the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain.
“i told these dreams to my magicians.
but no one could explain the dreams to me.
what do they mean?” 
then joseph said to pharaoh, “both of these dreams have the same meaning.
god is telling you what will happen soon.
the seven good cows and the seven good heads of grain are seven good years.
and the seven thin, sick-looking cows and the seven thin heads of grain mean that there will be seven years of hunger in this area.
these seven bad years will come after the seven good years.
god has shown you what will happen soon.
he will make these things happen just as i told you.
for seven years there will be plenty of food in egypt.
but then there will be seven years of hunger.
the people will forget how much food there had been in egypt before.
this famine will ruin the country.
it will be so bad that people will forget what it was like to have plenty of food.
“pharaoh, you had two dreams about the same thing.
that means god wanted to show you that he really will make this happen, and he will make it happen soon!
so, pharaoh, you should choose a wise, intelligent man and put him in charge of egypt.
then you should choose other men to collect food from the people.
during the seven good years, the people must give them one-fifth of all the food they grow.
in this way these men will collect all the food during the seven good years and store it in the cities until it is needed.
pharaoh, this food will be under your control.
then during the seven years of hunger, there will be food for the country of egypt.
and egypt will not be destroyed by the famine.” 
this seemed like a very good idea to pharaoh, and all his officials agreed.
then pharaoh told them, “i don’t think we can find anyone better than joseph to take this job!
god’s spirit is in him, making him very wise!” 
so pharaoh said to joseph, “god showed these things to you, so you must be the wisest man.
i will put you in charge of my country, and the people will obey all your commands.
i will be the only one more powerful than you.” 
pharaoh said to joseph, “i now make you governor over all of egypt.” 
then pharaoh gave his special ring to joseph.
the royal seal was on this ring.
pharaoh also gave joseph a fine linen robe and put a gold chain around his neck.
then he told joseph to ride in his second chariot.
pharaoh’s officials said, “let him be the governor over the whole land of egypt!” 
then pharaoh said to him, “i am pharaoh, the king over everyone in egypt, but no one else in egypt can lift a hand or move a foot unless you say he can.” 
then pharaoh gave joseph another name, zaphenath paneah.
he also gave joseph a wife named asenath.
she was the daughter of potiphera, a priest in the city of on.
so joseph became the governor over the whole country of egypt.
joseph was 30 years old when he began serving the king of egypt.
he traveled throughout the country of egypt.
during the seven good years, the crops in egypt grew very well.
joseph saved the food in egypt during those seven years and stored the food in the cities.
in every city he stored grain that grew in the fields around the city.
joseph stored so much grain that it was like the sands of the sea.
he stored so much grain that it could not be measured.
joseph’s wife, asenath, was the daughter of potiphera, the priest in the city of on.
before the first year of hunger came, joseph and asenath had two sons.
joseph named the first son manasseh.
he was given this name because joseph said, “god made me forget all my hard work and everything back home in my father’s house.” 
joseph named the second son ephraim.
joseph gave him this name because he said, “i had great troubles, but god has made me successful in everything.” 
for seven years people had all the food they needed, but those years ended.
then the seven years of hunger began, just as joseph had said.
no food grew anywhere in any of the countries in that area.
but in egypt people had plenty to eat because joseph had stored the grain.
the famine began, and the people cried to pharaoh for food.
pharaoh said to the egyptian people, “go ask joseph what to do.” 
there was famine everywhere, so joseph gave the people grain from the warehouses.
he sold the stored grain to the people of egypt.
the famine was bad in egypt, 
but the famine was bad everywhere.
so people from the countries around egypt had to come to joseph in egypt to buy grain.
chapter 40.
the message from the lord came to jeremiah after he was set free at the city of ramah.
nebuzaradan, the commander of the king of babylon’s special guards, found jeremiah in ramah.
jeremiah was bound with chains.
he was with all the captives from jerusalem and judah.
they were being taken away in captivity to babylon.
when commander nebuzaradan found jeremiah, he spoke to him.
he said, “jeremiah, the lord, your god, announced that this disaster would come to this place.
and now the lord has done everything just as he said he would do.
this disaster happened because you people of judah sinned against the lord.
you did not obey him.
but now, jeremiah, i will set you free.
i am taking the chains off your wrists.
if you want to, come with me to babylon, and i will take good care of you.
but if you don’t want to come with me, then don’t come.
look, the whole country is open to you.
go anywhere you want.
or go back to gedaliah son of ahikam, the son of shaphan.
the king of babylon has chosen gedaliah to be governor over the towns of judah.
go and live with gedaliah among the people.
or you can go anywhere you want.” then nebuzaradan gave jeremiah some food and a present and let him go.
so jeremiah went to gedaliah son of ahikam at mizpah.
he stayed with gedaliah among those who were left behind in the land of judah.
there were some soldiers from the army of judah, officers and their men, still out in the open country when jerusalem was destroyed.
they heard that the king of babylon had put gedaliah son of ahikam in charge of those who were left in the land.
those who were left were men, women, and children who were very poor.
they were not carried off to babylon as captives.
so the soldiers came to gedaliah at mizpah.
they were ishmael son of nethaniah, johanan and his brother jonathan, sons of kareah, seraiah son of tanhumeth, sons of ephai from netophah, and jaazaniah son of the maacathite, and the men who were with them.
gedaliah son of ahikam, son of shaphan, made an oath to make the soldiers and their men feel more secure.
this is what he said: “you soldiers, don’t be afraid to serve the babylonian people.
settle down in the land and serve the king of babylon.
if you do this, things will go well for you.
i myself will live in mizpah.
i will speak for you before the chaldeans who come here.
you leave that work to me.
you should harvest the wine, the summer fruit, and the oil.
put what you harvest in your storage jars.
live in the towns that you control.” 
all the people of judah who were in the countries of moab, ammon, edom, and all the other countries heard that the king of babylon had left some people of judah in the land.
and they heard that the king of babylon had chosen gedaliah son of ahikam, son of shaphan, to be governor over them.
when the people of judah heard this news, they came back to the land of judah.
they came back to gedaliah at mizpah from all the countries where they had been scattered.
so they came back and gathered a large harvest of wine and summer fruit.
johanan son of kareah and all the officers of the army of judah who were still in the open country came to gedaliah.
gedaliah was at the town of mizpah.
johanan and the officers with him said to gedaliah, “do you know that baalis, the king of the ammonites, wants to kill you?
he has sent ishmael son of nethaniah to kill you.” but gedaliah son of ahikam didn’t believe them.
then johanan son of kareah spoke to gedaliah in private at mizpah.
johanan said to gedaliah, “let me go and kill ishmael son of nethaniah.
no one will know anything about it.
we should not let ishmael kill you.
that would cause all the people of judah who are gathered around you to be scattered to different countries again.
and that would mean that the few survivors of judah would be lost.” 
but gedaliah son of ahikam said to johanan son of kareah, “don’t kill ishmael.
the things you are saying about ishmael are not true.” 
zechariah.
chapter 14.
look, the lord has a special day of judgment coming, when the riches you have taken will be divided in your city.
i will bring all the nations together to fight against jerusalem.
they will capture the city and destroy the houses.
the women will be raped, and half of the people will be taken away as prisoners.
but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
then the lord will go to war with those nations.
it will be a real battle.
at that time he will stand on the mount of olives, the hill east of jerusalem.
the mount of olives will split in half.
part of the mountain will move to the north, and part to the south.
a deep valley will open up, from the east to the west.
you will try to run away as that mountain valley comes closer and closer to you.
you will run away like the time you ran from the earthquake during the time of king uzziah of judah.
but the lord my god will come, and all his holy ones will be with him.
that will be a very special day.
there will not be any light, cold, or frost.
only the lord knows how, but there will not be any day or night.
then, when darkness usually comes, there will still be light.
at that time water will flow continually from jerusalem.
that stream will split and part of it will flow east, and part of it will flow west to the mediterranean sea.
and it will flow all year long, in the summer as well as in the winter.
and the lord will be the king of the whole world.
at that time all people will worship him as the only lord with only one name.
and the whole land from geba in the north to rimmon in the south past jerusalem will become a flat plain.
the city of jerusalem will stay in the same place, but it will be built high above the land around it.
it will reach from the benjamin gate to the first gate (that is, the corner gate) and from the tower of hananel to the king’s winepresses.
people will move to jerusalem because it will be a safe place to live.
it will never again be destroyed.
but the lord will punish the nations that fought against jerusalem.
he will send a terrible disease against them.
their skin will begin to rot while the people are still alive.
their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
that terrible disease will be in the enemy camp, and all their horses, mules, camels, and donkeys will catch that terrible disease.
at that time they will be afraid of the lord.
each man will grab his neighbor’s hand, and they will fight each other.
even judah will fight against jerusalem.
this will happen even while armies from all the nations are surrounding the city.
there will be much gold, silver, and clothing.
some of the people who came to fight jerusalem will survive.
and every year they will come to worship the king, the lord all-powerful.
they will come to celebrate the festival of shelters.
and if people from any of the families on earth don’t go to jerusalem to worship the king, the lord all-powerful, no rain will fall on their land.
if any of the families in egypt don’t come to celebrate the festival of shelters, they will get that terrible disease that the lord caused the enemy nations to get.
that will be the punishment for egypt, and for any other nation that does not come to celebrate the festival of shelters.
at that time even the harnesses on the horses will have the label, holy to the lord.
and all the pots used in the lord’s temple will be just as important as the bowls used at the altar.
in fact, every dish in jerusalem and judah will have the label, holy to the lord all-powerful.
all the people offering sacrifices will come, take those dishes, and cook their special meals in them.
at that time there will not be any merchants buying and selling things in the temple of the lord all-powerful.
chapter 7.
“these are the rules for the guilt offering, which is very holy: 
a priest must kill the guilt offering in the same place where they kill the burnt offerings.
then he must sprinkle the blood from the guilt offering around the altar.
“the priest must offer all the fat from the guilt offering.
he must offer the fat tail and the fat that covers the inner parts.
he must offer the two kidneys and the fat covering them at the lower back muscle.
he must also offer the fat part of the liver.
he must remove it with the kidneys.
he must bring these things to the altar as a gift to the lord.
it is a guilt offering.
“any male in a priest’s family may eat the guilt offering.
it is very holy, so it must be eaten in a holy place.
the guilt offering is like the sin offering.
the same rules are for both offerings.
the priest who does the sacrificing will get the meat for food.
he will also get the skin from the burnt offering.
every grain offering belongs to the priest who offers it.
that priest will get the grain offerings that were baked in an oven, or cooked on a frying pan, or in a baking dish.
the grain offerings will belong to aaron’s sons.
it doesn’t make any difference if the grain offerings are dry or mixed with oil.
the sons of aaron will all share this food.
“this is the law of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings that you bring to the lord: 
people can bring fellowship offerings to show their thanks to god.
if you bring your sacrifice to give thanks, you should also bring unleavened bread mixed with oil, wafers with oil poured over them, and loaves of fine flour mixed with oil.
you must also bring loaves of bread made with yeast to go with your fellowship offering.
offer one each of these different kinds of bread as a gift to the lord.
then it will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offerings.
the meat of the fellowship offering must be eaten on the same day it is offered as a way of showing thanks to god.
none of the meat should remain until the next morning.
“if you bring a fellowship offering simply because you want to give a gift to god or because it is part of a special promise you made to him, the sacrifice should be eaten the same day you offer it.
but if there is any left, it must be eaten the next day.
if any meat from this sacrifice is still left over on the third day, it must be burned in the fire.
if anyone eats the meat from the fellowship offering on the third day, the lord will not accept it as a sacrifice.
it will have no value for that person, and to the lord it will be like rotten meat!
whoever eats it will be responsible for their sin.
“people must not eat any of the meat that touches anything unclean.
they must burn this meat in the fire.
whoever is clean may eat the meat from the fellowship offering.
but anyone who is unclean and eats the meat from the fellowship offerings that was offered to the lord must be separated from their people.
“if you touch something that is unclean, it doesn’t matter if it was made unclean by a person, an animal, or some disgusting thing, you will become unclean.
and if you eat any of the meat from the fellowship offerings that was given to the lord, you must be separated from your people.” 
the lord said to moses, 
“tell the israelites: you must not eat any fat from your cattle, sheep, or goats.
you may use the fat from any animal that has died by itself or was torn by other animals, but you must never eat it.
whoever eats the fat from an animal that was offered as a gift to the lord must be separated from their people.
“no matter where you live, you must never eat blood from any bird or any animal.
anyone who eats blood must be separated from their people.” 
the lord said to moses, 
“tell the israelites: if you bring a fellowship offering to the lord, you must present that gift to the lord yourself.
you must bring the fat and the breast of the animal to the priest.
then he will lift up the breast in front of the lord to show it was presented to god.
the priest will burn the fat on the altar, but the breast of the animal will belong to aaron and his sons.
you must also give the right thigh from the fellowship offering as a gift to the priest.
that part of the fellowship offering will belong to the priest who carries the blood and fat to the altar.
i will accept the breast that was lifted up and the gift of the right thigh from the israelites.
then i will give these things to aaron and his sons.
this is their share from the fellowship offerings of the israelites forever.” 
those parts from the gifts offered to the lord were given to aaron and his sons.
whenever aaron and his sons serve as the lord’s priests, they get that share of the sacrifices.
the lord commanded the israelites to give those parts to the priests once they have been anointed.
that will be their share from the israelites forever.
these are the laws about burnt offerings, grain offerings, sin offerings, guilt offerings, fellowship offerings, and offerings for when the priests are appointed.
the lord gave these laws to moses on mount sinai when he commanded the israelites to bring their offerings to the lord in the desert of sinai.
chapter 39.
the traders who bought joseph took him down to egypt.
they sold him to the captain of pharaoh’s guard, potiphar.
the lord helped joseph become a successful man.
joseph lived in the house of his master, potiphar the egyptian.
potiphar saw that the lord was with joseph and that the lord helped joseph be successful in everything he did.
so potiphar was very happy with joseph.
he allowed joseph to work for him and to help him rule the house.
joseph was the ruler over everything potiphar owned.
after joseph was made the ruler over the house, the lord blessed the house and everything that potiphar owned.
the lord also blessed everything that grew in potiphar’s fields.
the lord did this because of joseph.
so potiphar allowed joseph to take responsibility for everything in the house.
potiphar didn’t have to worry about anything except deciding what to eat.
joseph was a very handsome, good-looking man.
after some time, the wife of joseph’s master began to pay special attention to him.
one day she said to him, “sleep with me.” 
but joseph refused.
he said, “my master trusts me with everything in his house.
he has given me responsibility for everything here.
my master has made me almost equal to him in his house.
i cannot sleep with his wife!
that is wrong!
it is a sin against god.” 
the woman talked with joseph every day, but he refused to sleep with her.
one day joseph went into the house to do his work.
he was the only man in the house at the time.
his master’s wife grabbed his coat and said to him, “come to bed with me.” but joseph ran out of the house so fast that he left his coat in her hand.
the woman saw that joseph had left his coat in her hand and had run out of the house.
she called to the men outside and said, “look!
this hebrew slave was brought here to make fun of us.
he came in and tried to attack me, but i screamed.
my scream scared him and he ran away, but he left his coat with me.” 
then she kept his coat until her husband, joseph’s master, came home.
she told her husband the same story.
she said, “this hebrew slave you brought here tried to attack me!
but when he came near me, i screamed.
he ran away, but he left his coat.” 
joseph’s master listened to what his wife said, and he became very angry.
so potiphar put joseph into the prison where the king’s enemies were held, and that is where joseph remained.
the lord was with joseph and continued to show his kindness to him, so the commander of the prison guards began to like joseph.
the commander of the guards put joseph in charge of all the prisoners.
joseph was their leader, but he still did the same work they did.
the commander of the guards trusted joseph with everything that was in the prison.
this happened because the lord was with joseph.
the lord helped joseph be successful in everything he did.
chapter 1.
this is what happened during the time when xerxes was king.
xerxes ruled over the 127 provinces from india to ethiopia.
king xerxes ruled from his throne in the capital city of susa.
in the third year of xerxes’ rule, he gave a party for his officers and leaders.
the army leaders and important leaders from all of persia and media were there.
the party continued for 180 days.
all during this time, king xerxes was showing the great wealth of his kingdom and the majestic beauty and wealth of his palace.
and when the 180 days were over, king xerxes gave another party that continued for seven days.
it was held in the inside garden of the palace.
all the people who were in the capital city of susa were invited, from the most important to the least important.
the inside garden had white and blue linen hangings around the room.
they were held in place with cords of white linen and purple material on silver rings and marble pillars.
there were couches made of gold and silver.
they were sitting on mosaic pavement made of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other expensive stones.
wine was served in golden cups, and every cup was different.
there was plenty of the king’s wine, because the king was very generous.
the king had given a command to his servants.
he told them that each guest must be given as much wine as he wanted, and the wine server obeyed the king.
queen vashti also gave a party for the women in the king’s palace.
on the seventh day of the party, king xerxes was in high spirits from drinking wine.
he gave a command to the seven eunuchs who served him.
the eunuchs were mehuman, biztha, harbona, bigtha, abagtha, zethar, and carcas.
he commanded them to bring queen vashti to him wearing her royal crown.
she was to come so that she could show her beauty to the leaders and important people.
she was very beautiful.
but when the eunuchs told queen vashti about the king’s command, she refused to come.
then the king was very angry.
it was the custom for the king to ask the advice of the experts about the law and punishments.
so king xerxes spoke with the wise men who understood the laws.
they were very close to the king.
their names were carshena, shethar, admatha, tarshish, meres, marsena, and memucan.
they were the seven most important officials of persia and media.
they had special privileges to see the king.
they were the highest officials in the kingdom.
the king asked them, “what does the law say must be done to queen vashti?
she has not obeyed the command of king xerxes that the eunuchs had taken to her.” 
then memucan answered the king with the other officials listening, “queen vashti has done wrong.
she has done wrong against the king and also against all the leaders and people of all the provinces of king xerxes.
i say this, because all the other women will hear about what queen vashti did.
then they will stop obeying their husbands.
they will say to their husbands, ‘king xerxes commanded queen vashti to be brought to him, but she refused to come.’ 
“today the wives of the persian and median leaders have heard what the queen did, and these women will be influenced by what she did.
they will do the same thing to the king’s important leaders.
and there will be plenty of disrespect and anger.
“so if it pleases the king, here is a suggestion: let the king give a royal command and let it be written in the laws of persia and media.
the laws of persia and media cannot be changed.
the royal command should be that vashti is never again to enter the presence of king xerxes.
let the king also give her royal position to someone else who is better than she is.
then when the king’s command is announced in all parts of his large kingdom, all the women will respect their husbands.
from the most important to the least important, all the women will respect their husbands.” 
the king and his important officials were happy with this advice, so king xerxes did as memucan suggested.
king xerxes sent letters to all parts of the kingdom.
he sent them to each province, written in its own language.
he sent them to each nation in its own language.
these letters announced in each person’s language that every man was to be the ruler over his own family.
chapter 21.
then job answered: 
“listen to what i say.
let this be your way of comforting me.
be patient while i speak.
then after i have finished speaking, you may make fun of me.
“my complaint is not against people.
there is a good reason why i am not patient.
look at me and be shocked.
put your hand over your mouth, and stare at me in shock!
when i think about what happened to me, i feel afraid and my body shakes!
why do evil people live long lives?
why do they grow old and successful?
they watch their children grow up and live to see their grandchildren.
their homes are safe and free from fear.
god does not punish them.
their bulls never fail to mate.
their cows have healthy calves.
they send their children out to play like lambs.
their children dance around.
they sing and dance to the sound of harps and flutes.
evil people enjoy success during their lives and then go to the grave without suffering.
they say to god, ‘leave us alone!
we don’t care what you want us to do!’ 
and they say, ‘who is god all-powerful?
we don’t need to serve him!
it will not help to pray to him!’ 
“of course, evil people don’t make their own success.
i would never follow their advice.
but how often does god blow out their light?
how often does trouble come to them?
how often does god get angry with them and punish them?
does god blow them away, as the wind blows straw or as strong winds blow the grain husks?
but you say, ‘god is saving their punishment for their children.’ no!
let god punish the evil people themselves so that they will know what they have done!
let them see their own punishment.
let them feel the anger of god all-powerful.
when their life is finished and they are dead, they will not care about the family they leave behind.
“no one can teach god anything he doesn’t already know.
god judges even those in high places.
one person dies after living a full and successful life, a life completely safe and comfortable, 
with a body that was well fed and bones that were still strong.
but another person dies after a hard life that has made them bitter, never having enjoyed anything good.
in the end, both of these people will lie together in the dirt.
the worms will cover them both.
“but i know what you are thinking, and i know you want to hurt me.
you might say, ‘show me a good man’s house.
now, show me where evil people live.’ 
“surely you have talked with travelers.
surely you will accept their stories.
evil people are spared when disaster comes.
they survive when god shows his anger.
no one criticizes them to their faces for how they lived.
no one punishes them for the evil they have done.
when they are carried to the grave, they will have someone to watch over the place they are buried.
so even the soil in the valley will be pleasant for them, and thousands of people will join their funeral procession.
“so your empty words are no comfort to me.
there is no truth at all in your answers!” 
psalm.
chapter 114.
the people of israel escaped from egypt.
yes, jacob’s descendants left that foreign country.
then judah became god’s special people, and israel became his kingdom.
the red sea saw this and ran away.
the jordan river turned and ran.
the mountains danced like rams.
the hills danced like lambs.
red sea, why did you run away?
jordan river, why did you turn and run away?
mountains, why did you dance like rams?
hills, why did you dance like lambs?
the earth shook in front of the lord, the god of jacob.
he is the one who caused water to flow from a rock.
he made a spring of water flow from that hard rock.
chapter 17.
there was a man named micah who lived in the hill country of ephraim.
micah said to his mother, “do you remember that someone stole 28 pounds of silver from you?
i heard you say a curse about that.
well, i have the silver.
i took it.” his mother said, “the lord bless you, my son.” 
micah gave the 28 pounds of silver back to his mother.
then she said, “i will give this silver as a special gift to the lord.
i will give it to my son so that he can make a statue and cover it with the silver.
so now, son, i give the silver back to you.” 
but micah gave the silver back to his mother.
so she took about 5 pounds of the silver and gave them to a silversmith.
he used the silver to make a statue covered with silver.
the statue was put in micah’s house.
micah had a temple for worshiping idols.
he made an ephod and some house idols.
then micah chose one of his sons to be his priest.
(at that time the israelites did not have a king, so everyone did what they thought was right.)
there was a young man who was a levite from the city of bethlehem in judah.
he had been living among the tribe of judah.
he left bethlehem to look for another place to live.
as he was traveling, he came to micah’s house in the hill country of the land of ephraim.
micah asked him, “where have you come from?” the young man answered, “i am a levite from the city of bethlehem in judah.
i am looking for a place to live.” 
then micah said to him, “live with me.
be my father and my priest.
i will give you 4 ounces of silver each year.
i will also give you clothes and food.” the levite did what micah asked.
the young levite agreed to live with micah.
he became like one of micah’s own sons.
micah chose him to be his priest.
so the young man became a priest and lived in micah’s house.
and micah said, “now i know that the lord will be good to me.
i know this because i have a man from the tribe of levi to be my priest.”

chapter 18.
during the third year that no rain fell, the lord said to elijah, “go meet with king ahab, and i will make it rain.” 
so elijah went to meet with ahab.
the famine was very bad in samaria.
so king ahab told obadiah to come to him.
obadiah was the man in charge of the king’s palace.
(obadiah was a true follower of the lord.
one time when jezebel was killing all the lord’s prophets, obadiah hid 100 prophets in two caves.
he put 50 prophets in one cave and 50 prophets in another cave.
then he brought them food and water.)
king ahab said to obadiah, “come with me.
we will look at every spring and every stream in the land.
we will see if we can find enough grass to keep our horses and mules alive.
then we will not have to kill our animals.” 
they decided where each of them would go to look for water.
ahab went in one direction by himself, and obadiah went in another direction by himself.
as obadiah was walking along the road by himself, he looked up, and there was elijah.
obadiah recognized him and bowed down to show his respect.
he said, “elijah?
is it really you, master?” 
elijah answered, “yes, it is me.
now, go and tell your master, the king, that i am here.” 
obadiah said, “if i tell ahab that i know where you are, he will kill me!
i have done nothing wrong to you.
why do you want me to die?
as surely as the lord your god lives, the king has been looking for you everywhere.
he has sent people to every country to find you.
he even made the rulers of those countries swear that you were not there.
now you want me to go and tell him that you are here!
if i go tell king ahab that you are here, the spirit of the lord might carry you away.
then when king ahab comes here and cannot find you, he will kill me!
i have followed the lord since i was a boy.
surely you have heard what i did when jezebel was killing the lord’s prophets.
i hid 100 of the lord’s prophets in caves.
i put 50 prophets in one cave and 50 in another.
i brought them food and water.
now you want me to go and tell the king that you are here.
the king will kill me!” 
elijah answered, “i serve the lord all-powerful.
as surely as he lives, i promise that i will stand before the king today.” 
so obadiah went to king ahab and told him where elijah was.
king ahab went to meet elijah.
when ahab saw elijah he said, “is that really you, the troublemaker of israel?” 
elijah answered, “i have not made trouble for israel.
you and your father’s family caused all the problems when you stopped obeying the lord’s commands and began following the false gods.
now tell all the people of israel to meet me at mount carmel.
also bring the 450 prophets of baal and the 400 prophets of the goddess asherah that queen jezebel supports.” 
so ahab called all the israelites and those prophets to mount carmel.
elijah came to all the people and said, “you must decide what you are going to do.
how long will you keep jumping from one side to the other?
if the lord is the true god, follow him.
but if baal is the true god, then follow him!” the people said nothing.
so elijah said, “i am the only prophet of the lord here, but there are 450 prophets of baal.
so bring us two bulls.
let the prophets of baal have one bull.
let them kill it, cut it into pieces, and then put the meat on the wood.
but don’t start the fire.
i will do the same with the other bull, and i will not start the fire either.
prophets of baal, pray to your god, and i will pray to the lord.
whichever god answers the prayer and starts the fire is the true god.” all the people agreed that this was a good idea.
then elijah said to the prophets of baal, “there are many of you, so you go first.
choose a bull and prepare it, but don’t start your fire.” 
so the prophets took the bull that was given to them and prepared it.
they started praying to baal and prayed until noon.
they said, “baal, please answer us!” but there was no sound.
no one answered.
then they began jumping around on the altar they had built.
at noon elijah began to make fun of them.
he said, “if baal really is a god, maybe you should pray louder!
maybe he is busy.
maybe he is thinking about something, or maybe he stepped out for a moment!
he could be sleeping!
maybe you should pray louder and wake him up!” 
so the prophets prayed louder.
they cut themselves with swords and spears.
(this was the way they worshiped.)
they cut themselves until they were bleeding all over.
the afternoon passed but the fire still had not started.
the prophets were out of control and continued to act this way until the time came for the evening sacrifice.
but nothing happened—there was no answer from baal.
there was no sound.
there was no one listening.
then elijah said to all the people, “now come here.” so they gathered around elijah.
the lord’s altar had been torn down, so elijah repaired it.
elijah found twelve stones.
there was one stone for each of the twelve tribes.
these twelve tribes were named for the twelve sons of jacob, the man who the lord had named israel.
elijah used these stones to repair the altar to honor the lord.
he dug a small ditch around the altar.
it was wide enough and deep enough to hold about 4 gallons of water.
then elijah put the wood on the altar.
he cut the bull into pieces and laid the pieces on the wood.
then he said, “fill four jars with water.
pour the water on the pieces of meat and on the wood.” then elijah said, “do it again.” then he said, “do it a third time.” 
the water ran down off the altar and filled the ditch.
at about the time for the afternoon sacrifice, the prophet elijah approached the altar and prayed, “lord, the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob, i ask you now to prove that you are the god of israel and that i am your servant.
show these people that it was you who commanded me to do all these things.
lord, answer my prayer.
show these people that you, lord, are god and that you are the one who is bringing them back to you.” 
then fire came down from the lord and burned the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the ground around the altar.
then it dried up all the water in the ditch.
all the people saw this happen and bowed down to the ground and began saying, “the lord is god!
the lord is god!” 
then elijah said, “get the prophets of baal!
don’t let any of them escape!” so the people captured all the prophets.
then elijah led them down to kishon creek and killed them all.
then elijah said to king ahab, “now go eat and drink.
a heavy rain is coming.” 
so king ahab went to eat.
at the same time elijah climbed to the top of mount carmel.
at the top of the mountain, elijah bent down.
he put his head between his knees.
then elijah said to his servant, “go up higher and look toward the sea.” the servant went and looked.
he came back and said, “i saw nothing.” elijah told him to go look again.
this happened seven times.
the seventh time, the servant came back and said, “i saw a small cloud the size of a man’s fist that was coming in from the sea.” elijah told the servant, “go tell king ahab to get his chariot ready and go home now.
if he does not leave now, the rain will stop him.” 
after a short time the sky was covered with dark clouds.
the wind began to blow, and a heavy rain began to fall.
ahab got in his chariot and started back to jezreel.
the power of the lord came to elijah.
he used his belt to hold up the bottom of his robe away from his feet.
then he ran ahead of king ahab all the way to jezreel.
chapter 28.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, say to the ruler of tyre, ‘this is what the lord god says: “‘you are very proud!
and you say, “i am a god!
i sit on the seat of gods in the middle of the seas.” “‘but you are a man and not god!
you only think you are a god.
you think you are wiser than daniel and no secret is hidden from you.
through your wisdom and understanding you have gotten riches for yourself.
and you put gold and silver in your treasuries.
through your great wisdom and trade, you have made your riches grow.
and now you are proud because of those riches.
“‘so this is what the lord god says: tyre, you thought you were like a god.
i will bring strangers to fight against you.
they are most terrible among the nations!
they will pull out their swords and use them against the beautiful things your wisdom brought you.
they will ruin your glory.
they will bring you down to the grave.
you will be like a sailor who died at sea.
that person will kill you.
will you still say, “i am a god”?
no, he will have you in his power!
you will see that you are a man, not god!
strangers will treat you like a foreigner and kill you, because i gave the command!’” this is what the lord god said.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, sing this sad song about the king of tyre.
say to him, ‘this is what the lord god says: “‘you were the perfect man— so full of wisdom and perfectly handsome.
you were in eden, the garden of god.
you had every precious stone— rubies, topaz, and diamonds, beryls, onyx, and jasper, sapphires, turquoise, and emeralds.
and each of these stones was set in gold.
you were given this beauty on the day you were created.
god made you strong.
you were one of the chosen cherubs who spread your wings over my throne.
i put you on the holy mountain of god.
you walked among the jewels that sparkled like fire.
you were good and honest when i created you, but then you became evil.
your business brought you many riches.
but they also put cruelty inside you, and you sinned.
so i treated you like something unclean and threw you off the mountain of god.
you were one of the chosen cherubs who spread your wings over my throne.
but i forced you to leave the jewels that sparkled like fire.
your beauty made you proud.
your glory ruined your wisdom.
so i threw you down to the ground, and now other kings stare at you.
you did many wrong things.
you were a very crooked merchant.
in this way you made the holy places unclean.
so i brought fire from inside you.
it burned you!
you burned to ashes on the ground.
now everyone can see your shame.
“‘all the people in other nations were shocked about what happened to you.
what happened to you will make people very afraid.
you are finished!’” 
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, look toward sidon and speak for me against that place.
say, ‘this is what the lord god says: “‘i am against you, sidon!
your people will learn to respect me.
i will punish sidon.
then people will know that i am the lord.
then they will learn that i am holy, and they will treat me that way.
i will send disease and death to sidon, and many people inside the city will die.
soldiers outside the city will kill many people.
then people will know that i am the lord!
“‘then the surrounding nations that hate israel will no longer be like stinging nettles and painful thorns.
and they will know that i am the lord god.’” 
this is what the lord god said: “i scattered the people of israel among other nations, but i will gather the family of israel together again.
then the nations will know that i am holy, and they will treat me that way.
at that time the people of israel will live in their land—i gave that land to my servant jacob.
they will live safely in the land.
they will build houses and plant vineyards.
i will punish the nations around them that hated them.
then the people of israel will live in safety, and they will know that i am the lord their god.” 
2 samuel.
chapter 11.
in the spring, when kings go out to war, david sent joab, his officers, and all the israelites out to destroy the ammonites.
joab’s army surrounded their capital city, rabbah.
david stayed in jerusalem.
one evening he got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his house.
from there he saw a woman bathing.
she was very beautiful, 
so david sent for his officers and asked them who she was.
an officer answered, “that is bathsheba, daughter of eliam.
she is the wife of uriah the hittite.” 
david sent messengers to go and bring bathsheba to him.
she had just purified herself after her monthly time of bleeding.
she went to david, he had sexual relations with her, and then she went back to her house.
later, bathsheba became pregnant.
she sent word to him saying, “i am pregnant.” 
david sent a message to joab.
“send uriah the hittite to me.” so joab sent uriah to david.
when uriah came, david asked him how joab was, how the soldiers were, and how the war was going.
then david said to uriah, “go home and relax.” so uriah left the king’s palace.
the king also sent a gift to uriah.
but uriah did not go home.
he slept outside the door of the king’s palace, as the rest of the king’s servants did.
the servants told david, “uriah did not go home.” then david said to uriah, “you came from a long trip.
why did you not go home?” 
uriah said to david, “the holy box and the soldiers of israel and judah are staying in tents.
my lord joab and my lord’s officers are camping out in the field.
so it is not right for me to go home to eat and drink and sleep with my wife.
as surely as you live, i will not do this.” 
david said to uriah, “stay here today.
tomorrow i will send you back to the battle.” uriah stayed in jerusalem until the next morning.
then david called uriah to come and see him.
uriah ate and drank with david.
david got him drunk, but uriah still did not go home.
that evening, uriah again slept at the palace with the rest of the king’s servants.
the next morning david wrote a letter to joab and made uriah carry the letter.
in the letter david wrote: “put uriah on the front lines where the fighting is the hardest.
then leave him there alone, and let him be killed in battle.” 
joab watched the city and saw where the bravest ammonites were.
he chose uriah to go to that place.
the men of the city came out to fight against joab.
some of david’s men were killed.
uriah the hittite was one of them.
then joab sent a report to david about what happened in the battle.
joab told the messenger to tell king david what had happened in the battle.
“the king might get upset and ask, ‘why did joab’s army go that close to the city to fight?
surely he knows that there are men on the city walls who can shoot arrows down at his men?
surely he remembers that at thebez a woman killed abimelech son of jerub besheth when he threw the top part of a grinding stone down from the wall.
so why did he go that close to the wall?’ if king david says something like that, tell him, ‘your officer, uriah the hittite, also died.’” 
the messenger went in and told david everything joab told him to say.
the messenger told david, “the men of ammon attacked us in the field.
we fought them and chased them all the way to the city gate.
then the men on the city wall shot arrows at your officers.
some of your officers were killed, including uriah the hittite.” 
david said to the messenger, “give this message to joab: ‘don’t be too upset about this.
a sword can kill one person as well as the next.
make a stronger attack against rabbah and you will win.’ encourage joab with these words.” 
bathsheba heard that her husband uriah had died, so she mourned for him.
after her time of sadness, david sent servants to bring her to his house.
she became david’s wife and gave birth to a son for david.
but the lord did not like what david had done.
chapter 31.
one day jacob heard laban’s sons talking.
they said, “jacob has taken everything that our father owned.
he has become rich—and he has taken all this wealth from our father.” 
then jacob noticed that laban was not as friendly as he had been in the past.
the lord said to jacob, “go back to your own land where your ancestors lived.
i will be with you.” 
so jacob told rachel and leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks of sheep and goats.
he said to them, “i have noticed that your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be.
but the god of my father has been with me.
you both know that i have worked as hard as i could for your father.
but he cheated me.
he has changed my pay ten times.
but during all this time, god protected me from all of laban’s tricks.
“at one time laban said, ‘you can keep all the goats with spots.
this will be your pay.’ after he said this, all the animals gave birth to spotted goats, so they were all mine.
but then laban said, ‘i will keep the spotted goats.
you can have all the striped goats.
that will be your pay.’ after he said this, all the animals gave birth to striped goats.
so god has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me.
“i had a dream during the time when the animals were mating.
i saw that the only male goats that were mating were the ones with stripes and spots.
the angel of god spoke to me in that dream.
the angel said, ‘jacob!’ “i answered, ‘yes!’ 
“the angel said, ‘look, only the striped and spotted goats are mating.
i am causing this to happen.
i have seen all the wrong things laban has been doing to you.
i am doing this so that you can have all the new baby goats.
i am the god who came to you at bethel, and there you made an altar, poured olive oil on it, and made a promise to me.
now i want you to be ready to go back to the country where you were born.’” 
rachel and leah answered jacob, “our father has nothing to give us when he dies.
he treated us like strangers.
he sold us to you, and then he spent all the money that should have been ours.
god took all this wealth from our father, and now it belongs to us and our children.
so you should do whatever god told you to do.” 
so jacob prepared for the trip.
he put his children and his wives on camels.
then they began traveling back to the land of canaan, where his father lived.
all the flocks of animals that jacob owned walked ahead of them.
he carried everything with him that he had gotten while he lived in paddan aram.
while laban was gone to cut the wool from his sheep, rachel went into his house and stole the false gods that belonged to her father.
jacob tricked laban the aramean.
he did not tell laban he was leaving.
jacob took his family and everything he owned and left quickly.
they crossed the euphrates river and traveled toward the hill country of gilead.
three days later laban learned that jacob had run away.
so he gathered his men together and began to chase jacob.
after seven days laban found jacob near the hill country of gilead.
that night god came to laban in a dream and said, “be careful!
be careful of every word you say to jacob.” 
the next morning laban caught up with jacob.
jacob had set up his camp on the mountain, so laban and all his men set up their camp in the hill country of gilead.
laban said to jacob, “why did you trick me?
why did you take my daughters like they were women you captured during war?
why did you run away without telling me?
if you had told me, i would have given you a party.
there would have been singing and dancing with music.
you didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye.
you were very foolish to do this!
i have the power to really hurt you.
but last night the god of your father came to me in a dream.
he warned me not to hurt you in any way.
i know that you want to go back to your home.
that is why you left.
but why did you steal the gods from my house?” 
jacob answered, “i left without telling you, because i was afraid.
i thought you would take your daughters away from me.
but i did not steal your gods.
if you find anyone here with me who has taken your gods, they will be killed.
your men will be my witnesses.
you can look for anything that belongs to you.
take anything that is yours.” (jacob did not know that rachel had stolen laban’s gods.)
so laban went and looked through jacob’s camp.
he looked in jacob’s tent and then in leah’s tent.
then he looked in the tent where the two slave women stayed, but he did not find the gods from his house.
then he went into rachel’s tent.
rachel had hidden the gods inside her camel’s saddle, and she was sitting on them.
laban looked through the whole tent, but he did not find the gods.
and rachel said to her father, “father, don’t be angry with me.
i am not able to stand up before you.
i am having my monthly time of bleeding.” so laban looked through the camp, but he did not find the gods from his house.
then jacob became very angry and said, “what wrong have i done?
what law have i broken?
what right do you have to chase me and stop me?
you looked through everything i own and found nothing that belongs to you.
if you found something, show it to me.
put it here where our men can see it.
let our men decide which one of us is right.
i have worked 20 years for you.
during all that time none of the baby sheep and goats died during birth.
and i have not eaten any of the rams from your flocks.
any time a sheep was killed by wild animals, i always paid for the loss myself.
i did not take the dead animal to you and say that it was not my fault.
but i was robbed day and night.
in the daytime the sun took away my strength, and at night sleep was taken from my eyes by the cold.
i worked 20 years like a slave for you.
for the first 14 years i worked to win your two daughters.
the last six years i worked to earn your animals.
and during that time you changed my pay ten times.
but the god of my ancestors, the god of abraham and the fear of isaac, was with me.
if god had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing.
but he saw the trouble that i had and the work that i did, and last night god proved that i am right.” 
laban said to jacob, “these women are my daughters.
these children belong to me, and these animals are mine.
everything you see here belongs to me, but i can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children.
so i am ready to make an agreement with you.
we will set up a pile of stones to show that we have an agreement.” 
so jacob found a large rock and put it there to show that he had made an agreement.
he told his men to find some more rocks and to make a pile of rocks.
then they ate beside the pile of rocks.
laban named that place yegar sahadutha.
but jacob named that place galeed.
laban said to jacob, “this pile of rocks will help us both remember our agreement.” that is why jacob called the place galeed.
then laban said, “let the lord watch over us while we are separated from each other.” so that place was also named mizpah.
then laban said, “if you hurt my daughters, remember that god will punish you.
if you marry other women, remember that god is watching.
here are the rocks that i have put between us, and here is the special rock to show that we made an agreement.
this pile of rocks and this one special rock both help us to remember our agreement.
i will never go past these rocks to fight against you, and you must never go on my side of these rocks to fight against me.
may the god of abraham, the god of nahor, and the god of their ancestors judge us guilty if we break this agreement.” jacob’s father, isaac, called god “fear.” so jacob used that name to make the promise.
then jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice on the mountain.
and he invited his men to come and share a meal.
after they finished eating, they spent the night on the mountain.
early the next morning laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye.
he blessed them and went back home.
chapter 33.
“now, job, listen to me.
listen carefully to what i say.
i am ready to speak.
my heart is honest, so my words are sincere.
i will speak the truth about what i know.
god’s spirit made me.
my life comes from god all-powerful.
listen to me and answer if you can.
get your arguments ready to face me.
you and i are the same before god.
he used clay to make us both.
don’t be afraid of me.
i will not be hard on you.
“but, job, i heard what you said.
these were your very words: 
‘i am pure and innocent; i did nothing wrong; i am not guilty!
but god found an excuse to attack me.
he treats me like an enemy.
he put chains on my feet and watches everything i do.’ 
“but you are wrong about this, and i will prove it to you.
god knows more than any of us.
you are arguing with god!
why do you think he should explain everything to you?
but maybe god does explain what he does but speaks in ways that people don’t understand.
he may speak in a dream, or in a vision at night, when people are in a deep sleep lying in their beds.
he may whisper something in their ear, and they are frightened when they hear his warnings.
god warns people to stop them from doing wrong and to keep them from becoming proud.
he does this to save them from death.
he wants to keep them from being destroyed.
“or those who are sick in bed might be suffering punishment from god.
the pain that makes their bones ache might be a warning from him.
they feel so bad they cannot eat.
even the best food makes them sick.
their bodies might waste away until they become thin and all their bones stick out.
they might be close to death, their lives about to end.
but maybe one of god’s thousands of angels is watching over them, to speak for them and tell about the good things they have done.
maybe the angel will be kind and say to god, ‘save this one from the place of death!
i have found a way to pay for his life.’ 
then that person’s body will become young and strong again.
he will be as he was when he was young.
he will pray and god will answer.
he will worship god and shout with joy.
he will again stand as right before god.
he will tell everyone, ‘i sinned.
i changed good into bad, but god didn’t give me the punishment i deserved!
god saved me from going down to the place of death.
now i can enjoy life again.’ 
“god does all these things for people again and again.
he wants them to be saved from death so that they can enjoy life.
“job, pay attention and listen to me.
be quiet and let me talk.
but if you have an answer, go ahead and speak.
tell me your argument.
i would be happy to know that you are innocent!
but if you have nothing to say, then listen to me.
be quiet, and i will teach you wisdom.” 
2 chronicles.
chapter 6.
then solomon said, “the lord chose to live in a dark cloud.
but, lord, i have built a beautiful house for you to live in forever.” 
king solomon turned around and blessed all the israelites gathered in front of him.
he said, “praise the lord, the god of israel, who has done what he promised my father david.
the lord said, 
‘i led israel out of egypt long ago.
and in all that time, i have not chosen a city from any tribe of israel for a place to build a house for my name.
i have not chosen a man to lead my people, the people of israel.
but now i have chosen jerusalem as a place for my name, and i have chosen david to lead my people israel.’ 
“my father david wanted to build a temple for the name of the lord, the god of israel.
but the lord said to my father, ‘david, it is good that you want to build a temple for my name, 
but you cannot build the temple.
your son will build the temple for my name.’ 
now, the lord has done what he said he would do.
i am the new king in my father’s place.
david was my father.
now i am israel’s king.
that is what the lord promised, and i have built the temple for the name of the lord, the god of israel.
i have put the box of the agreement in the temple.
the lord’s agreement with israel is in that box.” 
solomon had made a bronze platform and placed it in the middle of the outer courtyard.
the platform was 5 cubits long, 5 cubits wide, and 3 cubits tall.
solomon stood on the platform and faced the lord’s altar.
in front of all the israelites who were gathered together, solomon kneeled, spread his hands out toward heaven, 
and said, “lord, god of israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth.
you keep the agreement that you made with your people.
you are kind and loyal to those who follow you with all their heart.
you made a promise to your servant, my father david, and you kept that promise.
you made that promise with your own mouth, and with your own hands you made it come true today.
now, lord, god of israel, keep the other promises you made to your servant david, my father.
you said, ‘david, if your sons carefully obey me as you did, you will always have someone from your family ruling the people of israel.’ 
again, lord, god of israel, i ask you to keep the promise you made to your servant, my father david.
“but, god, will you really live here with us on the earth?
the whole sky and the highest heaven cannot contain you.
certainly this house that i built cannot contain you either.
but please listen to my prayer and my request.
i am your servant, and you are the lord my god.
hear this prayer that i am praying to you today.
in the past you said, ‘i will be honored there.’ so please watch over this temple, night and day.
and listen to my prayer as i turn toward this temple and pray to you.
and please listen to our prayers in the future when i and your people israel turn to this place and pray to you.
we know that you live in heaven.
we ask you to hear our prayer there and forgive us.
“whoever does wrong to someone will be brought to this altar.
if they are not guilty, they will make an oath and promise that they are innocent.
please listen from heaven and judge them.
if they are guilty, please show us that they are guilty.
and if they are innocent, please show us that they are not guilty.
“sometimes your people israel will sin against you, and their enemies will defeat them.
then the people will come back to you and praise you.
they will pray to you in this temple.
in heaven, please listen to the prayers of your people israel.
forgive them for their sins and let them have their land again.
you gave this land to their ancestors.
“sometimes they will sin against you, and you will stop the rain from falling on their land.
then they will pray toward this place and praise your name.
you will make them suffer, and they will be sorry for their sins.
so please listen in heaven to their prayer.
then forgive us for our sins.
teach the people to live right.
then, please send rain to the land you gave them.
“the land might become very dry so that no food will grow on it.
or maybe a great sickness will spread among the people.
maybe all the food that is growing will be destroyed by insects.
or your people might be attacked in some of their cities by their enemies.
or many of your people might get sick.
when any of these things happen, people feel the need to spread their hands in prayer toward this temple.
please listen to their prayer while you are in your home in heaven and forgive them and help them.
only you know what people are really thinking, so only you can judge them fairly.
do this so that your people will fear and respect you all the time that they live in this land you gave to our ancestors.
“people from other places will hear about your greatness and your power.
they will come from far away to pray at this temple.
from your home in heaven, please listen to their prayers.
please do everything those from other places ask you.
then they will fear and respect you the same as your people in israel.
then all people everywhere will know that i built this temple to honor you.
“sometimes you will command your people to go and fight against their enemies.
then your people will turn toward this city that you have chosen and the temple that i built in your honor, and they will pray to you.
listen to their prayers from your home in heaven, and help them.
“your people will sin against you.
i know this because everyone sins.
and you will be angry with your people.
you will let their enemies defeat them.
their enemies will make them prisoners and carry them to some faraway land.
in that faraway land, your people will think about what happened.
they will be sorry for their sins, and they will pray to you.
they will say, ‘we have sinned and done wrong.’ 
they will be in that faraway land of their enemies, but they will turn back to you.
they will feel sorry for their sins with their whole heart and soul.
they will turn toward the land you gave their ancestors.
they will look toward the city you chose and toward the temple i built, and they will pray to you.
please listen from your home in heaven.
accept their prayers when they beg for help, and help them.
forgive your people who have sinned against you.
now, my god, i ask you, open your eyes and your ears.
listen and pay attention to the prayers we are praying in this place.
“now, lord god, get up and come to your special place, the box of the agreement that shows your strength.
lord god, may your priests be dressed with salvation, and may your true followers be happy about these good things.
lord god, accept your anointed king.
remember your loyal servant david.” 
psalm.
chapter 70.
to the director: a song of david to help people remember.
please, god, rescue me!
lord, hurry and help me!
people are trying to kill me.
please disappoint them.
humiliate them!
they want to hurt me.
make them run away in shame.
may those who make fun of me be too embarrassed to speak.
but may those who come to you be happy and rejoice.
may those who love being saved by you always be able to say, “praise god!” 
i am only a poor, helpless man.
god, please hurry to me.
you are my helper, the one who can save me.
lord, don’t be too late!
2 kings.
chapter 8.
elisha talked to the woman whose son he had brought back to life.
he said, “you and your family should move to another country, because the lord has decided that there will be a famine here.
it will last for seven years.” 
so the woman did what the man of god said.
she went with her family to stay in the land of the philistines for seven years.
after seven years she returned from the land of the philistines.
she went to speak with the king to ask him to help her get back her house and land.
the king was talking with gehazi, the servant of the man of god.
the king said to gehazi, “please tell me all the great things elisha has done.” 
gehazi was telling the king about elisha bringing a dead person back to life.
at that same time the woman whose son elisha brought back to life went to the king.
she wanted to ask him to help her get back her house and land.
gehazi said, “my lord and king, this is the woman, and this is the son who elisha brought back to life.” 
the king asked the woman what she wanted, and she told him.
then the king chose an officer to help her.
the king said, “give to the woman all that belongs to her.
and give her all the harvest of her land from the day she left the country until now.” 
elisha went to damascus.
king ben-hadad of aram was sick.
someone told ben-hadad, “the man of god has come here.” 
then the king ben-hadad said to hazael, “take a gift and go meet the man of god.
ask him to ask the lord if i will get well from my sickness.” 
so hazael went to meet elisha.
hazael brought a gift with him.
he brought all kinds of good things from damascus.
it took 40 camels to carry everything.
hazael came to elisha and said, “your follower, king ben-hadad of aram, sent me to you.
he asks if he will get well from his sickness.” 
then elisha said to hazael, “go and tell ben-hadad, ‘you will live.’ but really the lord told me, ‘he will die.’” 
elisha began to stare.
he stared for an embarrassingly long time.
then the man of god began to cry.
hazael said, “sir, why are you crying?” elisha answered, “i am crying because i know the bad things you will do to the israelites.
you will burn their strong cities and kill their young men with swords.
you will kill their babies and split open their pregnant women.” 
hazael said, “i am not a powerful man!
how can i do these great things?” elisha answered, “the lord showed me that you will be king over aram.” 
then hazael left elisha and went to his king.
ben-hadad said to hazael, “what did elisha say to you?” he answered, “elisha told me that you will live.” 
but the next day hazael took a thick cloth and dipped it in water.
then he held it on ben-hadad’s face until he died.
then hazael became the new king.
jehoram son of jehoshaphat was the king of judah.
he began to rule in the fifth year that joram son of ahab was king of israel.
jehoram was 32 years old when he began to rule.
he ruled eight years in jerusalem.
but jehoram lived as the kings of israel and did what the lord saw as evil.
he lived as the people from ahab’s family, because his wife was ahab’s daughter.
but the lord would not destroy judah because of the promise to his servant david.
he had promised david that someone from his family would always be king.
in jehoram’s time edom broke away from judah’s rule.
the people of edom chose a king for themselves.
then jehoram and all his chariots went to zair.
the edomite army surrounded them, but jehoram and his officers attacked them and escaped.
jehoram’s soldiers all ran away and went home.
so the edomites broke away from the rule of judah.
and they have been free from the rule of judah until today.
at the same time libnah also broke away from judah’s rule.
all the things jehoram did are written in the book, the history of the kings of judah.
jehoram died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of david.
jehoram’s son ahaziah became the new king.
ahaziah son of jehoram became the king of judah in the 12th year that joram son of ahab was king of israel.
ahaziah was 22 years old when he began to rule.
he ruled one year in jerusalem.
his mother’s name was athaliah.
she was the daughter of king omri of israel.
ahaziah did what the lord said was wrong.
he did many bad things, just as the people from ahab’s family had done.
he lived like this because his wife was from ahab’s family.
joram was from ahab’s family.
ahaziah went with joram to fight against king hazael of aram at ramoth gilead.
the arameans wounded joram.
king joram went back to israel so that he could get well from those wounds.
he went to the area of jezreel.
ahaziah son of jehoram was the king of judah.
ahaziah went to jezreel to see joram.
chapter 37.
when king hezekiah listened to their message, he tore his clothes to show he was upset.
then he put on sackcloth and went to the lord’s temple.
hezekiah sent eliakim, the palace manager, shebna, the royal secretary, and the elders of the priests to the prophet, isaiah son of amoz.
they wore the special clothes that showed they were sad and upset.
they said to isaiah, “king hezekiah has commanded that today will be a special day for sorrow and sadness.
it will be a very sad day—as sad as when a baby should be born, but there is not enough strength for the birth.
the commander’s master, the king of assyria, has sent him to say bad things about the living god.
maybe the lord your god will hear it and prove the enemy is wrong.
so pray for those who are still left alive.” 
when king hezekiah’s officers came to isaiah, 
he said to them, “give this message to your master, hezekiah: the lord says, ‘don’t be afraid of what you heard from the commanders!
don’t believe what those “boys” from the king of assyria said to make fun of me.
look, i will send a spirit against the king of assyria.
he will get a report that will make him return to his own country.
and i will cut him down with a sword in his own country.’” 
the commander heard that the king of assyria had left lachish.
he found him at libnah, fighting against that city.
then the king of assyria got a report that said, “king tirhakah of ethiopia is coming to fight you.” so the king of assyria sent messengers to hezekiah again.
he told them, “tell king hezekiah of judah these things: ‘don’t be fooled by the god you trust when he says, “jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of assyria.” 
you have heard what the kings of assyria did to all the other countries.
we destroyed them completely.
will you be saved?
did the gods of those people save them?
no, my ancestors destroyed them all.
they destroyed the cities of gozan, haran, rezeph, and the people of eden living in tel assar.
where is the king of hamath?
the king of arpad?
the king of the city of sepharvaim?
the kings of hena and ivvah?’” 
hezekiah received the letters from the messengers and read them.
then he went up to the lord’s temple and laid the letters out in front of the lord.
he prayed to the lord: 
“lord all-powerful, god of israel, you sit as king above the cherub angels.
you alone are the god who rules all the kingdoms on earth.
you made heaven and earth.
lord, please pay attention and hear this.
open your eyes, lord, and see what is happening.
listen to all the insults against the living god in the message sennacherib sent!
it is true, lord.
the kings of assyria did destroy all those nations.
they did throw the gods of those nations into the fire, but they were not real gods.
they were only wood and stone—statues that people made.
that is why the kings of assyria could destroy them.
but you are the lord our god, so please save us from the king of assyria.
then all the other nations will know that you are the lord, the only god.” 
then isaiah son of amoz sent this message to hezekiah: “the lord, the god of israel, says, ‘you prayed to me about the message that came from king sennacherib of assyria.
i have heard you.’ 
“so this is the lord’s message against sennacherib: ‘the virgin daughter zion does not think you are important.
she makes fun of you.
daughter jerusalem shakes her head at you and laughs behind your back.
but who was it that you insulted and made fun of?
who was it that you spoke against?
you were speaking against the holy one of israel.
you acted like you were great and he was nothing.
you sent your officers to insult the lord.
this is what you said: “i took my many chariots up the high mountains deep inside lebanon.
i cut down its tallest cedars and its best fir trees.
i have been on its highest mountain and deep inside its forests.
i dug wells and drank water from new places.
i dried up the rivers of egypt and walked where the water was.” 
‘how could you say this, sennacherib?
did no one ever tell you that i, the lord, planned these things long ago?
from ancient times i decided what would happen.
and now i have made it happen.
i let you tear down strong cities and change them into piles of rocks.
the people living there had no power.
they were afraid and confused.
they were about to be cut down like grass and plants in the field.
they were like grass growing on the housetops, dying before it grows tall.
i know all about your battles; i know when you rested, when you went out to war, and when you came home.
i also know when you got upset at me.
yes, you were upset at me.
i heard your proud insults.
so i will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth.
then i will turn you around and lead you back the way you came.’” 
then the lord said, “i will give you a sign to show you that these words are true.
you will not be able to plant seeds this year, so next year you will eat grain that grew wild from the previous year’s crop.
but in the third year, you will eat grain from seeds that you planted.
you will harvest your crops, and you will have plenty to eat.
you will plant vineyards and eat grapes from them.
“the people from the family of judah who have escaped and are left alive will be like plants that send their roots deep into the ground and produce fruit above the ground.
that is because a few people will come out of jerusalem alive.
there will be survivors coming from mount zion.” the strong love of the lord all-powerful will do this.
so the lord says this about the king of assyria: “he will not come into this city or shoot an arrow here.
he will not bring his shields up against this city or build up a hill of dirt to attack its walls.
he will go back the way he came.
he will not come into this city.
the lord says this!
i will protect this city and save it.
i will do this for myself and for my servant david.” 
that night the angel of the lord went out and killed 185,000 men in the assyrian camp.
when the people got up in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies.
so king sennacherib of assyria went back to nineveh and stayed there.
one day sennacherib was in the temple of his god nisroch, worshiping him.
his sons adrammelech and sharezer killed him with a sword and ran away to ararat.
so sennacherib’s son esarhaddon became the new king of assyria.
chapter 30.
“but now men younger than i make fun of me— men whose fathers were too worthless to put with my sheep dogs.
their fathers are still too weak to be of any use to me.
all their strength is gone.
they are starving with nothing to eat, so they chew on the dry, ruined land.
they pull up salt plants in the desert and eat the roots from the broom tree.
they are forced away from other people, who shout at them as if they were thieves.
they must live in the dry riverbeds, hillside caves, and holes in the ground.
they howl in the bushes and huddle together under thornbushes.
they are a bunch of worthless people without names, who were forced to leave their country.
“now their sons sing songs to make fun of me.
my name has become a bad word to them.
they hate me and stay far away from me, except when they come to spit in my face!
god has taken the string from my bow and made me weak, so they feel free to do whatever they want to me.
they attack me on my right side.
they knock my feet out from under me.
they build ramps to attack and destroy me like a city.
they guard the road so that i cannot escape.
they succeed in destroying me, without help from anyone.
they break a hole in the wall and come rushing through it, and the crashing rocks fall on me.
i am shaking with fear.
they chased my honor away like dust in the wind.
my safety disappears like a cloud.
“now my life is almost gone, and soon i will die.
days of suffering have grabbed me.
all my bones ache at night.
pain never stops chewing on me.
god grabbed the collar of my coat and twisted my clothes out of shape.
he threw me into the mud, and i became like dust and ashes.
“god, i cry out to you for help, but you don’t answer.
i stand up and pray, but you don’t pay attention to me.
you have become cruel to me; you use your power to hurt me.
you let the strong wind blow me away.
you throw me around in the storm.
i know you will lead me to my death, to that place where all the living must go.
“surely no one would attack a man who is already ruined, when he is hurt and crying for help.
god, you know that i cried for those who were in trouble.
you know that i mourned for the poor.
but when i hoped for good, trouble came instead.
when i looked for light, darkness came.
i constantly feel upset.
and my suffering has only just begun.
i am always sad and depressed, without any relief.
i stand up in the public meeting and cry for help, 
making sad sounds like the wild dogs, like the ostriches in the desert.
my skin is burned and peeling away.
my body is hot with fever.
my harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow.
my flute makes sad sounds like someone crying.
chapter 18.
all the israelites gathered together at shiloh where they set up the meeting tent.
the israelites controlled that country.
they had defeated all the enemies in that land.
but at this time there were still seven tribes of israel that had not yet received their land.
so joshua said to the israelites, “why do you wait so long to take your land?
the lord, the god of your ancestors, has given this land to you.
so each of your tribes should choose three men.
i will send them out to study the land.
they will describe that land, and then they will come back to me.
they will divide the land into seven parts.
the people of judah will keep their land in the south.
the people of joseph will keep their land in the north.
but you should describe the land and divide it into seven parts.
bring the map to me, and we will throw lots to let the lord our god decide how to divide the land among the tribes.
the levites don’t get a share of the land.
their share is to serve the lord as priests.
gad, reuben, and half the tribe of manasseh have already received the land that was promised to them.
they are on the east side of the jordan river.
moses, the lord’s servant, gave them that land.” 
so the men who were chosen went to look at the land and write down what they saw.
joshua told them, “go through the land and describe it in writing.
then come back to me at shiloh.
i will throw lots and let the lord decide how you will share the land.” 
so the men went into the land.
as they walked through it, they wrote down what they saw.
they listed all the cities and divided the land into seven parts.
then they went back to joshua at shiloh.
joshua threw lots for them in front of the lord at shiloh.
in this way joshua divided the land and gave each tribe its part of the land.
the tribe of benjamin was given the land that was between the areas of judah and joseph.
each family in the tribe of benjamin got its land.
this is the land that was chosen for benjamin: 
the northern border started at the jordan river.
it went along the northern edge of jericho.
then the border went west into the hill country.
it continued until it was just east of beth aven.
then the border went south to luz (bethel), then down to ataroth addar.
ataroth addar is on the hill south of lower beth horon.
at the hill south of beth horon, the border turned south and went along the west side of the hill.
the border went to kiriath baal (also called kiriath jearim).
this town belonged to the people of judah.
this was the western border.
the southern border started near kiriath jearim and went to the river of nephtoah.
then the border went down to the bottom of the hill near the valley of ben hinnom, north of rephaim valley.
it continued down hinnom valley just south of the jebusite city.
then the border went on to en rogel.
there it turned north, went to en shemesh, and then continued on to geliloth.
(geliloth is near the adummim pass in the mountains.)
the border went down to the great stone that was named for bohan, the son of reuben.
it continued to the northern part of beth arabah.
then the border went down into the jordan valley.
then it went to the northern part of beth hoglah and ended at the north shore of the dead sea.
this is where the jordan river flows into that sea.
that was the southern border.
the jordan river was the eastern border.
so this was the land that was given to the tribe of benjamin.
these were the borders on all sides.
each family got its land.
these are their cities: jericho, beth hoglah, emek keziz, 
beth arabah, zemaraim, bethel, 
avvim, parah, ophrah, 
kephar ammoni, ophni, and geba.
there were twelve cities and the fields around them.
the tribe of benjamin also got gibeon, ramah, beeroth, 
mizpah, kephirah, mozah, 
rekem, irpeel, taralah, 
zelah, haeleph, the jebusite city (that is, jerusalem), gibeah, and kiriath.
there were 14 cities and the fields around them.
the tribe of benjamin got all these areas.
chapter 118.
praise the lord because he is good!
his faithful love will last forever!
israel, say it: “his faithful love will last forever!” 
aaron’s family, say it: “his faithful love will last forever!” 
you people worshiping the lord, say it: “his faithful love will last forever!” 
i was in trouble, so i called to the lord for help.
the lord answered and made me free.
the lord is with me, so i will not be afraid.
no one on earth can do anything to harm me.
the lord is my helper.
i will see my enemies defeated.
it is better to trust in the lord than to trust in people.
it is better to trust in the lord than to trust in great leaders.
many enemies surrounded me, but with the lord’s power i defeated them.
they surrounded me again and again, but i defeated them with the lord’s power.
they surrounded me like a swarm of bees, but they were quickly destroyed like a fast-burning bush.
i defeated them with the lord’s power.
my enemy attacked me and almost destroyed me, but the lord helped me.
the lord is my strength and my reason for singing.
he saved me!
you can hear the victory celebration in the homes of those who live right.
the lord has shown his great power again!
the lord’s arm is raised in victory.
the lord has shown his great power again.
i will live and not die, and i will tell what the lord has done.
the lord punished me, but he did not let me die.
gates of goodness, open for me, and i will come in and worship the lord.
those are the lord’s gates, and only good people can go through them.
lord, i thank you for answering my prayer.
i thank you for saving me.
the stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone.
the lord made this happen, and we think it is wonderful!
this is the day the lord has made.
let us rejoice and be happy today!
the people say, “praise the lord!
the lord saved us!
welcome to the one who comes in the name of the lord.” the priests answer, “we welcome you to the lord’s house!
the lord is god, and he accepts us.
tie up the lamb for the sacrifice and carry it to the horns of the altar.” 
lord, you are my god, and i thank you.
my god, i praise you!
praise the lord because he is good.
his faithful love will last forever.
chapter 25.
these are some more wise sayings from solomon.
these proverbs were copied by servants of hezekiah, the king of judah.
we honor god for the things he keeps secret.
but we honor kings for the things they can discover.
we cannot discover how high the sky is above us or how deep the earth is below.
the same is true with the minds of kings.
we cannot understand them.
remove the worthless things from silver to make it pure, and a worker can make something beautiful.
take the evil advisors away from a king, and goodness will make his kingdom strong.
don’t brag about yourself before the king and pretend you are someone important.
it is much better for the king to invite you to take a more important position than to embarrass you in front of his officials.
don’t be too quick to tell a judge about something you saw.
you will be embarrassed if someone else proves you wrong.
if you want to tell your friends about your own problems, tell them.
but don’t discuss what someone told you in private.
whoever hears it will lose their respect for you and will never trust you again.
saying the right thing at the right time is like a golden apple in a silver setting.
wise advice to a listening ear is like gold earrings or fine jewelry.
to his master who sent him, a messenger who can be trusted is as refreshing as a drink of cold water on a hot summer day.
people who promise to give gifts but never give them are like clouds and wind that bring no rain.
with patience, you can make anyone change their thinking, even a ruler.
gentle speech is very powerful.
honey is good, but don’t eat too much of it, or you will be sick.
and don’t visit your neighbors’ homes too often, or they will begin to hate you.
a person who gives false testimony against a neighbor is as deadly as a club, a sword, or a very sharp arrow.
never depend on a liar in times of trouble.
it’s like chewing with a bad tooth or walking with a crippled foot.
singing happy songs to a sad person is as foolish as taking a coat off on a cold day or mixing soda and vinegar.
if your enemies are hungry, give them something to eat.
if they are thirsty, give them some water.
this will make them feel the burning pain of shame, and the lord will reward you for being good to them.
just as wind blowing from the north brings rain, telling secrets brings anger.
it is better to live in a small corner of the roof than to share the house with a woman who is always arguing.
good news from a faraway place is like a cool drink of water when you are hot and thirsty.
good people who don’t stand strong against evil are like springs that have been polluted or pools that have turned dirty and muddy.
just as eating too much honey is not good, it is not good for people to always be looking for honor.
people who cannot control themselves are like cities without walls to protect them.
chapter 41.
“can you catch leviathan with a fishhook?
can you tie his tongue with a rope?
can you put a rope through his nose or a hook through his jaw?
will he beg you to let him go free?
will he speak to you with gentle words?
will he make an agreement with you and promise to serve you forever?
will you play with leviathan as you would play with a bird?
will you put a rope on him so that your girls can play with him?
will fishermen try to buy him from you?
will they cut him into pieces and sell him to the merchants?
can you throw spears into his skin or head?
“if you ever lay a hand on leviathan, you will never do it again!
just think about the battle that would be!
do you think you can defeat him?
well, forget it!
there is no hope.
just looking at him will scare you!
no one is brave enough to wake him up and make him angry.
“well, no one can challenge me either!
i owe nothing to anyone.
everything under heaven belongs to me.
“i will tell you about leviathan’s legs, his strength, and his graceful shape.
no one can pierce his skin.
it is like armor!
no one can force him to open his jaws.
the teeth in his mouth scare people.
his back has rows of shields tightly sealed together.
they are so close to each other that no air can pass between them.
the shields are joined to each other.
they hold together so tightly that they cannot be pulled apart.
when leviathan sneezes, it is like lightning flashing out.
his eyes shine like the light of dawn.
burning torches come from his mouth.
sparks of fire shoot out.
smoke pours from his nose like burning weeds under a boiling pot.
his breath sets coals on fire, and flames shoot from his mouth.
his neck is very powerful.
people are afraid and run away from him.
there is no soft spot in his skin.
it is as hard as iron.
his heart is like a rock; he has no fear.
it is as hard as a millstone.
when he gets up, even the strongest people are afraid.
they run away when he swings his tail.
swords, spears, and darts only bounce off when they hit him.
these weapons don’t hurt him at all!
he breaks iron as easily as straw.
he breaks bronze like rotten wood.
arrows don’t make him run away.
rocks thrown at him seem as light as chaff.
when a wood club hits him, it feels to him like a piece of straw.
he laughs when anyone throws a spear at him.
the skin on his belly is like sharp pieces of broken pottery.
he leaves tracks in the mud like a threshing board.
he stirs up the water like a boiling pot.
he makes it bubble like a pot of boiling oil.
when he swims, he leaves a sparkling path behind him.
he stirs up the water and makes it white with foam.
no animal on earth is like him.
he is an animal made without fear.
he looks down on the proudest of creatures.
he is king over all the wild animals.” 
proverbs.
chapter 2.
my son, pay attention to what i say.
remember my commands.
listen to wisdom, and do your best to understand.
ask for good judgment.
cry out for understanding.
look for wisdom like silver.
search for it like hidden treasure.
if you do this, you will understand what it means to respect the lord, and you will come to know god.
the lord is the source of wisdom; knowledge and understanding come from his mouth.
he gives good advice to honest people and shields those who do what is right.
he makes sure that people are treated fairly.
he watches over his loyal followers.
if you listen to him, you will understand what is just and fair and how to do what is right.
you will gain wisdom, and knowledge will bring you joy.
planning ahead will protect you, and understanding will guard you.
these will keep you from following the wrong path and will protect you from those who have evil plans.
such people have left the straight path and now walk in darkness.
they enjoy doing evil and are happy with the confusion it brings.
their ways are crooked; they lie and cheat.
wisdom will save you from that other woman, another man’s wife, who tempts you with sweet words.
she married when she was young, but then she left her husband.
she forgot the marriage vows she made before god.
going into her house leads to death.
she will lead you to the grave.
all who enter lose their life and never return.
wisdom will help you follow the example of good people and stay on the right path.
honest people will live in the land, and those who do right will remain there.
but the wicked will be forced to leave.
those who lie and cheat will be thrown out of the land.
chapter 11.
the people started complaining about their troubles.
the lord heard their complaints.
he heard these things and became angry.
fire from the lord burned among the people.
the fire burned some of the areas at the edge of the camp.
so the people cried to moses for help.
he prayed to the lord and the fire stopped burning.
so that place was called taberah.
the people gave the place that name because the lord caused a fire to burn in their camp.
the foreigners who had joined the israelites began wanting other things to eat.
soon all the israelites began complaining again.
the people said, “we want to eat meat!
we remember the fish we ate in egypt.
that fish cost us nothing.
we also had good vegetables like cucumbers, melons, chives, onions, and garlic.
but now we have lost our strength.
we never eat anything—only this manna!” 
(the manna was like small coriander seeds, and it looked like sap from a tree.
the people gathered the manna.
then they used rocks to crush it and cooked it in a pot.
or they ground it into flour and made thin cakes with it.
the cakes tasted like sweet cakes cooked with olive oil.
the manna fell on the ground each night when the ground became wet with dew.)
moses heard the people complaining.
people from every family were sitting by their tents and complaining.
the lord became very angry, and this made moses very upset.
he asked the lord, “why did you bring this trouble on me?
i am your servant.
what did i do wrong?
what did i do to upset you?
why did you give me responsibility over all these people?
you know that i am not the father of all these people.
you know that i did not give birth to them.
but i must take care of them, like a nurse carrying a baby in her arms.
why do you force me to do this?
why do you force me to carry them to the land that you promised to our fathers?
i don’t have enough meat for all these people!
and they continue complaining to me.
they say, ‘give us meat to eat!’ 
i cannot take care of all these people alone.
the burden is too heavy for me.
if you plan to continue giving me their troubles, kill me now.
if you accept me as your servant, let me die now.
then i will be finished with all my troubles!” 
the lord said to moses, “bring to me 70 of the elders of israel.
these men are the leaders among the people.
bring them to the meeting tent.
let them stand there with you.
then i will come down and speak with you there.
the spirit is on you now.
but i will also give some of that spirit to them.
then they will help you take care of the people.
in this way you will not have to be responsible for these people alone.
“tell the people this: make yourselves ready for tomorrow.
tomorrow you will eat meat.
the lord heard you when you cried out and said, ‘we need meat to eat!
it was better for us in egypt!’ so now the lord will give you meat.
and you will eat it.
you will eat it for more than one, or two, or five, or ten, or even twenty days!
you will eat that meat for a whole month until you are sick of it.
this will happen to you because you complained against the lord.
he lives among you and knows what you need, but you cried and complained to him!
you said, ‘why did we ever leave egypt?’” 
moses said, “there are 600,000 soldiers here, and you say, ‘i will give them enough meat to eat for a whole month!’ 
if we were to kill all the sheep and cattle, that would still not be enough to feed this many people for a month.
and if we caught all the fish in the sea, it would not be enough for them!” 
but the lord said to moses, “don’t limit my power!
you will see that i can do what i say i can do.” 
so moses went out to speak with the people.
he told them what the lord said.
then he gathered 70 of the elders together and told them to stand around the tent.
then the lord came down in the cloud and spoke to moses.
he put on the 70 elders some of the same spirit that was on moses.
after the spirit came down on them, they began to prophesy.
but that was the only time they ever did this.
two of the elders, eldad and medad, did not go out to the tent.
their names were on the list of elders, but they stayed in camp.
but the spirit also came on them, and they began prophesying in camp.
a young man ran and told moses.
the man said, “eldad and medad are prophesying in camp.” 
joshua son of nun said to moses, “moses, sir, you must stop them!” (joshua had been moses’ helper since joshua was a boy.)
but moses answered, “are you afraid the people will think that i am not the leader now?
i wish that all the lord’s people were able to prophesy.
i wish that the lord would put his spirit on all of them!” 
then moses and the leaders of israel went back to the camp.
then the lord made a powerful wind to blow in from the sea, and it blew quail into the area all around the camp.
there were so many birds that the ground was covered.
they were about three feet deep on the ground.
there were quail in every direction as far as a man can walk in one day.
they went out and gathered quail all that day and all that night.
and they gathered quail all the next day too!
the smallest amount anyone gathered was 60 bushels.
then the people spread the quail meat all around the camp to dry in the sun.
people began to eat the meat, but the lord became very angry.
while the meat was still in their mouths, before the people could finish eating it, the lord caused the people to become very sick and die.
so the people named that place kibroth hattaavah, because there they buried those who had the strong desire for meat.
from kibroth hattaavah the people traveled to hazeroth and stayed there.
chapter 121.
a song for going up to the temple.
i look up to the hills, but where will my help really come from?
my help will come from the lord, the creator of heaven and earth.
he will not let you fall.
your protector will not fall asleep.
israel’s protector does not get tired.
he never sleeps.
the lord is your protector.
the lord stands by your side, shading and protecting you.
the sun cannot harm you during the day, and the moon cannot harm you at night.
the lord will protect you from every danger.
he will protect your soul.
the lord will protect you as you come and go, both now and forever!
chapter 20.
“when you go out to battle against your enemies, and you see horses, chariots, and many more people than you have, you must not be afraid of them.
the lord your god is with you—and he brought you out of egypt.
“when you go to the battle, the priest must go to the soldiers and speak to them.
the priest will say, ‘men of israel, listen to me!
today you are going against your enemies in battle.
don’t lose your courage.
don’t be troubled or upset.
don’t be afraid of the enemy.
the lord your god is going with you to help you fight against your enemies.
he will help you win!’ 
“the levite officials will say to the soldiers, ‘is there any man here who has built a new house but has not yet dedicated it?
that man should go back home.
he might be killed in the battle, and then another person will dedicate that man’s house.
is there any man here who has planted a vineyard but has not yet gathered any of the grapes?
that man should go back home.
if that man dies in the battle, someone else will enjoy the fruit from his field.
is there any man here who is engaged to be married?
that man should go back home.
if he dies in the battle, another man will marry the woman he is engaged to.’ 
“these levite officials must also say to the people, ‘is there any man here who has lost his courage and is afraid?
he should go back home.
then he will not cause the other soldiers to lose their courage too.’ 
then, after the officers have finished speaking to the army, they must choose captains to lead the soldiers.
“when you go to attack a city, you must first offer peace to the people there.
if they accept your offer and open their gates, all the people in that city will become your slaves and be forced to work for you.
but if the city refuses to make peace with you and fights against you, you should surround the city.
and when the lord your god lets you take the city, you must kill all the men in it.
but you may take for yourselves the women, the children, the cattle, and everything else in the city.
you may use all these things.
the lord your god has given these things to you.
that is what you must do to all the cities that are very far from you—the cities that are not in the land where you will live.
“but when you take cities in the land that the lord your god is giving you, you must kill everyone.
you must completely destroy all the people—the hittites, amorites, canaanites, perizzites, hivites, and jebusites.
the lord your god has commanded you to do this.
so then they will not be able to teach you to sin against the lord your god or to do any of the terrible things they do when they worship their gods.
“when you are making war against a city, you might surround that city for a long time.
you must not cut down the fruit trees around that city.
you may eat the fruit from these trees, but you must not cut them down.
these trees are not the enemy, so don’t make war against them.
but you may cut down the trees that you know are not fruit trees.
you may use these trees to build weapons for making war against that city.
you may use them until the city falls.
chapter 52.
to the director: a maskil of david written when doeg the edomite went to saul and told him, “david is in ahimelech’s house.” great warrior, why are you bragging about the evil you did?
you are a disgrace to god.
you are nothing but a hired killer, making plans to hurt people and making up lies!
you love evil more than goodness.
you love lies more than truth.
selah 
you and your lying tongue love to hurt people.
so god will ruin you forever!
he will grab you and pull you from your home, like someone pulling up a plant by the roots!
selah 
good people will see this and learn to fear and respect god.
they will laugh at you and say, 
“look what happened to the warrior who did not depend on god.
that fool thought his wealth and lies would protect him.” 
but i am like a green olive tree growing in god’s temple.
i will trust god’s faithful love forever and ever.
god, i praise you forever for what you have done.
i will speak your name before your followers because it is so good!
chapter 9.
if my head were filled with water, and if my eyes were a fountain of tears, i would cry day and night for my people who have been destroyed.
if only i had a place in the desert— a house where travelers spend the night— so i could leave my people.
i could go away from them, because they are all unfaithful to god.
they have all turned against him.
“they use their tongues like a bow; lies fly from their mouths like arrows.
lies, not truth, have grown strong in this land.
they go from one sin to another.
they don’t know me.” this is what the lord said.
“watch your neighbors!
don’t trust your own brothers, because every brother is a cheat.
every neighbor talks behind your back.
everyone lies to their neighbor.
no one speaks the truth.
the people of judah have taught their tongues to lie.
they sinned until they were too tired to come back.
one bad thing followed another, and lies followed lies.
the people refused to know me.” this is what the lord said.
so the lord all-powerful says, “a worker heats metal in a fire to test it and see if it is pure.
i will test the people of judah like that.
i have no other choice.
my people have sinned.
the people of judah have tongues as sharp as arrows.
their mouths speak lies.
they all speak kindly to their neighbors, but they are secretly planning ways to attack them.
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things?” this message is from the lord.
“you know i should punish a nation such as this.
i should give it the punishment it deserves.” 
i, jeremiah, will cry for the mountains.
i will sing a funeral song for the empty fields, because all the animals were taken away.
no one travels there now.
the sounds of cattle cannot be heard.
the birds have flown away, and the animals are gone.
the lord says, “i will make the city of jerusalem a pile of garbage.
it will be a home for jackals.
i will destroy the cities in the land of judah, so no one will live there.” 
is there a man who is wise enough to understand these things?
is there someone who has been taught by the lord?
can anyone explain his message?
why was the land ruined?
why was it made like an empty desert where no one goes?
the lord answered, “it is because the people of judah stopped following my teachings.
i gave them my teachings, but they refused to listen to me.
they did not follow my teachings.
the people of judah lived their own way.
they were stubborn.
they followed the false god baal.
their fathers taught them to follow those false gods.” 
so the lord all-powerful, the god of israel, says, “i will soon make the people of judah eat bitter food and drink poisoned water.
i will scatter the people of judah throughout other nations.
they will live in strange nations that they and their fathers never knew about.
i will send men with swords.
they will kill the people of judah.
they will kill them until all the people are gone.” 
this is what the lord all-powerful says: “now think about these things!
call for the women who get paid to cry at funerals.
send for the people who are good at that job.
the people say, ‘let those women come quickly and cry for us.
then our eyes will fill with tears that flow over our eyelids like streams of water.’ 
“the sound of loud crying is heard from zion: ‘we are really ruined!
we are so ashamed!
we must leave our land, because our houses have been destroyed.
now our houses are only piles of rock.’” 
now, women of judah, listen to the message from the lord.
listen to the words from his mouth.
teach your daughters how to cry loudly.
each of them must learn to sing this funeral song: 
“death has climbed in through our windows and has come into our palaces.
death has come to our children who play in the streets and to the young men who meet in the public places.” 
this is what you should say: “the lord says, ‘dead bodies will lie in the fields like dung.
their bodies will lie on the ground like grain a farmer has cut.
but there will be no one to gather them.’” 
this is what the lord says: “the wise must not brag about their wisdom.
the strong men must not brag about their strength.
the rich must not brag about their money.
but if someone wants to brag, then let them brag about this: let them brag that they learned to know me.
let them brag that they understand that i am the lord, that i am kind and fair, and that i do good things on earth.
i love this kind of bragging.” this message is from the lord.
this is what the lord says: “the time is coming when i will punish all those who are circumcised only in the body.
i am talking about the people of the nations of egypt, judah, edom, ammon, moab, and all those who live in the desert.
the circumcision they do is not the kind the lord wants.
but the people of israel are not really circumcised either.
they are not circumcised in their hearts.” 
micah.
chapter 6.
now hear what the lord says: “present your argument to the mountains.
let the hills hear your story.
the lord has a complaint against his people.
mountains, listen to the lord’s complaint.
foundations of the earth, hear the lord.
he will prove that israel is wrong!” 
he says, “my people, tell me what i did!
did i do something wrong against you?
did i make life too hard for you?
