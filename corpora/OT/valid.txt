but a man of god came to amaziah and said, “king, don’t let the army of israel go with you.
the lord is not with israel or the people of ephraim.
maybe you will make yourself strong and ready for war, but god can help you win or help you lose.” 
amaziah said to the man of god, “but what about the money i already paid to the israelite army?” the man of god answered, “the lord has plenty.
he can give you much more than that.” 
so amaziah sent the israelite army back home to ephraim.
these men were very angry with the king and the people of judah.
they went back home very angry.
then amaziah became very brave and led his army to the salt valley in the country of edom.
there his army killed 10,000 men from seir.
they also captured 10,000 men from seir and took them to the top of a cliff.
then the army of judah threw them from the top of the cliff while they were still alive and their bodies were broken on the rocks below.
meanwhile, the israelite army was attacking towns in judah.
they attacked the towns from beth horon all the way to samaria.
they killed 3000 people and took many valuable things.
they were angry because amaziah didn’t let them join him in the war.
amaziah came home after he defeated the edomites.
he brought the idols that the people of seir worshiped.
he started to worship those idols.
he bowed down in front of them and burned incense to them.
the lord was very angry with amaziah, so he sent a prophet to him.
the prophet said, “amaziah, why have you worshiped the gods those people worship?
those gods could not even save their own people from you!” 
when the prophet spoke, amaziah said to the prophet, “we never made you an advisor to the king.
be quiet!
if you don’t be quiet, you will be killed.” the prophet became quiet, but then said, “god has decided to destroy you because you did this and didn’t listen to my advice.” 
king amaziah of judah talked with his advisors.
then he sent a message to king jehoash of israel.
amaziah said to jehoash, “let’s meet face to face.” jehoash was jehoahaz’s son.
jehoahaz was jehu’s son.
then jehoash sent his answer to amaziah.
jehoash was the king of israel and amaziah was the king of judah.
jehoash told this story: “a little thornbush of lebanon sent a message to a big cedar tree of lebanon.
the little thornbush said, ‘let your daughter marry my son.’ but a wild animal came and walked over the thornbush and destroyed it.
you say to yourself, ‘i have defeated edom!’ you are proud and you brag.
but you should stay at home.
there is no need for you to get into trouble.
if you fight me, you and judah will be destroyed.” 
but amaziah refused to listen.
god made this happen.
god planned to let israel defeat judah, because the people of judah followed the gods the people of edom followed.
so king jehoash of israel met king amaziah of judah face to face at the town of beth shemesh in judah.
israel defeated judah.
every man of judah ran away to his home.
jehoash captured amaziah at beth shemesh and took him to jerusalem.
amaziah was the son of joash, and joash was the son of jehoahaz.
jehoash tore down the wall of jerusalem from the ephraim gate to the corner gate, a section about 600 feet long.
he took the gold and silver and all the other things in god’s temple that obed edom was responsible for.
jehoash also took the treasures from the king’s palace and some people as hostages.
then he went back to samaria.
amaziah lived 15 years after jehoash died.
amaziah’s father was king joash of judah.
everything else amaziah did, from beginning to end, is written in the book, the history of the kings of judah and israel.
when amaziah stopped obeying the lord, the people in jerusalem made plans against amaziah.
he ran away to the town of lachish.
but the people sent men to lachish and they killed amaziah there.
then they carried his body on horses and buried him with his ancestors in the city of judah.
chapter 22.
it is better to be respected than to be rich.
a good name is worth more than silver or gold.
the rich and the poor are the same.
the lord made them all.
wise people see trouble coming and get out of its way, but fools go straight to it and suffer for it.
respect the lord and be humble.
then you will have wealth, honor, and true life.
evil people are trapped by many troubles, but those who want to live avoid them.
teach children in a way that fits their needs, and even when they are old, they will not leave the right path.
the rich rule over the poor.
the one who borrows is a slave to the one who lends.
those who spread trouble will harvest trouble.
in the end, they will be destroyed for the trouble they caused.
generous people will be blessed, because they share their food with the poor.
get rid of the proud who laugh at what is right, and trouble will leave with them.
all arguments and insults will end.
love a pure heart and kind words, and the king will be your friend.
the lord watches over true knowledge, and he opposes those who try to deceive others.
a person who is lazy and wants to stay home says, “there is a lion outside, and i might be killed in the streets!” 
the sin of adultery is a trap, and the lord gets very angry with those who fall into it.
children do foolish things, but if you punish them, they will learn not to do them.
these two things will make you poor: hurting the poor to make yourself rich and giving gifts to the rich.
listen carefully to these words from the wise.
pay attention to what i have learned.
it will be good for you to remember these words and have them ready when they are needed.
i will teach you these things now.
i want you to trust the lord.
i have written 30 sayings for you.
these are words of advice and wisdom.
they will teach you things that you can know for sure to be true.
then you can give good answers to the one who sent you.
it is easy to steal from the poor, but don’t do it.
and don’t take advantage of them in court.
the lord is on their side.
he supports the poor, and he will take from those who take from them.
don’t be friends with people who become angry easily.
don’t stay around quick-tempered people.
if you do, you may learn to be like them.
then you will have the same problems they do.
don’t promise to pay someone else’s debt.
if you cannot pay, you will lose everything you have.
so why should you lose the bed you sleep on?
never move an old property line that was marked long ago by your ancestors.
skilled workers will always serve kings.
they will never have to work for less important people.
chapter 20.
wine and beer make people lose control; they get loud and stumble around.
and that is foolish.
an angry king is like a roaring lion.
if you make him angry, you could lose your life.
people who refuse to argue deserve respect.
any fool can start an argument.
some people are too lazy to plant seeds.
so at harvest time, they look for food and find nothing.
getting information from someone can be like getting water from a deep well.
if you are smart, you will draw it out.
you might call many people your “friends,” but it is hard to find someone who can really be trusted.
when people live good, honest lives, their children are blessed.
when the king sits and judges people, he must look carefully to separate the evil from the good.
can anyone say their heart is pure?
who can say, “i am free from sin”?
the lord hates for people to use the wrong weights and measures to cheat others.
even children show what they are like by the things they do.
you can see if their actions are pure and right.
it was the lord who gave us eyes for seeing and ears for hearing.
if you love to sleep, you will become poor.
use your time working and you will have plenty to eat.
when buying something, people always say, “it’s no good.
it costs too much.” then they go away and tell others what a good deal they got.
the right knowledge can bring you gold, pearls, and other expensive things.
if someone promises to pay the debt of a stranger, get a coat or something from him to keep until the debt is paid.
it may seem to be a good thing to get something by cheating, but in the end, it will be worth nothing.
get good advice when you make your plans.
before you start a war, find good advisors.
you cannot trust someone who would talk about things told in private.
so don’t be friends with someone who talks too much.
those who would curse their father or mother are like a lamp that goes out on the darkest night.
if your wealth was easy to get, it will not be worth much to you.
don’t ever say, “i’ll pay them back for what they did to me!” wait for the lord.
he will make things right.
the lord hates for people to use the wrong weights to cheat others.
it is wrong to use scales that are not accurate.
the lord guides our steps, and we never know where he will lead us.
think carefully before you promise to give something to god.
later, you might wish you had not made that promise.
like a farmer who separates wheat from the chaff, a wise king will decide who is wrong and crush them.
your spirit is like a lamp to the lord.
he is able to see into your deepest parts.
a king who is loyal and true will keep his power.
loyalty will keep his kingdom strong.
we admire a young man for his strength, but we respect an old man for his gray hair.
a beating can remove evil and make you completely clean.
chapter 21.
the canaanite king of arad lived in the negev.
he heard that the israelites were coming on the road to atharim, so the king went out and attacked the israelites.
arad captured some of the people and made them prisoners.
then the israelites made a special promise to the lord: “please help us defeat these people.
if you do this, we will give their cities to you.
we will totally destroy them.” 
the lord listened to the israelites and helped them defeat the canaanites.
they completely destroyed the canaanites and their cities.
so that place was named hormah.
the israelites left mount hor and traveled on the road that goes to the red sea.
they did this to go around the country of edom.
but the people became impatient.
they began complaining against god and moses.
the people said, “why did you bring us out of egypt?
we will die here in the desert!
there is no bread and no water!
and we hate this terrible food!” 
so the lord sent poisonous snakes among the people.
the snakes bit the people, and many of the israelites died.
the people came to moses and said, “we know that we sinned when we spoke against the lord and against you.
pray to the lord.
ask him to take away these snakes.” so moses prayed for them.
the lord said to moses, “make a bronze snake and put it on a pole.
if anyone is bitten by a snake, that person should look at the bronze snake on the pole.
then that person will not die.” 
so moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole.
then when a snake bit anyone, that person looked at the bronze snake on the pole and lived.
the israelites left that place and camped at oboth.
then they left oboth and camped at iye abarim in the desert east of moab.
they left that place and camped in zered valley.
then they moved and camped across from the arnon river in the desert.
this river started at the ammonite border.
the valley was the border between moab and the amorites.
that is why these words are written in the book of the wars of the lord: “… and waheb in suphah, and the valleys of the arnon, 
and the hills by the valleys that lead to the town of ar.
these places are at the border of moab.” 
the israelites left that place and traveled to beer.
there is a well in beer, where the lord said to moses, “bring the people together here, and i will give them water.” 
then the israelites sang this song: “well, flow with water!
sing about it!
great men dug this well.
important leaders dug this well.
they dug this well with their staffs and walking sticks.
it is a gift in the desert.” 
the people traveled from mattanah to nahaliel.
then they traveled from nahaliel to bamoth.
they traveled from bamoth to the valley of moab.
in this place the top of the pisgah mountain looks over the desert.
the israelites sent some men to king sihon of the amorites.
the men said to the king, 
“allow us to travel through your country.
we will not go through any field or vineyard.
we will not drink water from any of your wells.
we will travel only along king’s road.
we will stay on that road until we have traveled through your country.” 
but king sihon would not allow the israelites to travel through his country.
he gathered together his army and marched out to the desert to fight against the israelites.
the king’s army fought against the israelites at jahaz.
but the israelites defeated the king and took his land from the arnon river to the jabbok river.
the israelites took the land as far as the ammonite border.
they stopped at that border because it was strongly defended by the ammonites.
israel took all the amorite cities and began living in them.
they even defeated the city of heshbon and all the small towns around it.
heshbon was the city where sihon, the amorite king, lived.
in the past sihon had fought with the king of moab.
sihon had taken the land as far as the arnon river.
that is why the singers sing this song: “go in and rebuild heshbon!
make sihon’s city strong.
a fire began in heshbon.
that fire began in sihon’s city.
the fire destroyed ar in moab.
it burned the hills above arnon river.
it is bad for you, moab.
you lost chemosh’s people.
his sons ran away.
his daughters were taken prisoners by sihon, king of the amorites.
but we defeated those amorites.
we destroyed their towns from heshbon to dibon, from nashim to nophah, near medeba.” 
so the israelites made their camp in the land of the amorites.
moses sent some men to look at the town of jazer.
then the israelites captured that town and the small towns that were around it.
they forced the amorites who were living there to leave.
then the israelites traveled on the road toward bashan.
king og of bashan got his army and marched out to meet the israelites.
he fought against them at edrei.
but the lord said to moses, “don’t be afraid of that king.
i will allow you to defeat him.
you will take his whole army and all his land.
do the same to him as you did to sihon, the amorite king who lived in heshbon.” 
so the israelites defeated og and his army.
they killed him, his sons, and all his army.
then the israelites took all his land.
2 chronicles.
chapter 7.
when solomon finished praying, fire came down from the sky and burned up the burnt offering and the sacrifices.
the glory of the lord filled the temple.
the priests could not enter the lord’s temple because the glory of the lord filled it.
when all the israelites saw the fire come down from heaven and the glory of the lord on the temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces low to the ground.
they worshiped and thanked the lord, singing, “the lord is good.
his faithful love will last forever.” 
then king solomon and all the israelites offered sacrifices to the lord.
king solomon offered 22,000 bulls and 120,000 sheep.
so the king and the people showed that they had dedicated the temple to god.
the priests stood ready to do their work.
the levites stood with the instruments they would use to play music to the lord.
king david had made these instruments to use when they gave thanks to the lord and sang, “his faithful love will last forever.” the priests blew their trumpets as they stood across from the levites.
and all the israelites were standing.
king solomon also dedicated the middle of the courtyard, the part that is in front of the temple of the lord.
there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat from the animals that were used as fellowship offerings.
he did this because the bronze altar he had built was too small to hold all these offerings.
so there at the temple, king solomon and all the people of israel celebrated the festival.
people came from as far away as hamath pass in the north and the border of egypt in the south.
this huge crowd of people enjoyed themselves for seven days.
on the eighth day, they had a holy meeting because they had celebrated for seven days.
they made the altar holy and it was to be used only for worshiping the lord.
and they celebrated the festival for seven days.
on the 23rd day of the seventh month, solomon told the people to go home.
all the people thanked the king, said goodbye, and went home.
they were happy because of all the good things that the lord had done for david his servant and for his people israel.
so solomon finished building the lord’s temple and the king’s palace.
solomon did everything that he had planned to do in building a house for the lord and for himself.
then the lord appeared to solomon at night and said to him, “solomon, i have heard your prayer, and i have chosen this place for myself to be a house for sacrifices.
when i close the sky so that there is no rain, or command the locusts to destroy the land, or send sicknesses to my people 
and if my people who are called by my name become humble and pray, and look for me, and turn away from their evil ways, then i will hear them from heaven.
i will forgive their sin and heal their land.
now, my eyes are open, and my ears will pay attention to the prayers prayed in this place.
i have chosen this temple, and i have made it a holy place.
so i will be honored there forever.
i will watch over it and think of it always.
you must serve me with a pure and honest heart, just as your father david did.
you must obey my laws and do everything that i commanded you.
if you obey all i have commanded, and if you obey my laws and rules, 
then i will make you a strong king and your kingdom will be great.
that is the agreement i made with david your father when i told him that israel would always be ruled by one of his descendants.
“but if you don’t obey my laws and commands that i gave you, and if you worship other gods and serve them, 
then i will take the israelites out from my land that i gave them.
and i will leave this temple that i have made holy for my name.
i will make this temple something that all the nations will speak evil about.
everyone who sees it will be amazed.
they will ask, ‘why did the lord do this terrible thing to this land and to this temple?’ 
people will say, ‘this happened because they left the lord, the god of their ancestors.
he brought them out of egypt, but they decided to follow other gods.
they began to worship and to serve those gods.
that is why he caused all these bad things to happen to them.’” 
1 samuel.
chapter 19.
saul told his son jonathan and his officers to kill david.
but jonathan liked david very much, 
so he warned him.
“be careful!
saul is looking for a chance to kill you.
in the morning go into the field and hide.
i will go out into the field with my father.
we will stand in the field where you are hiding.
i will talk to my father about you, and i will tell you what i learn.” 
jonathan talked to his father saul.
jonathan said good things about david.
he said, “you are the king.
david is your servant.
david hasn’t done anything wrong to you, so don’t do anything wrong to him.
he has always been good to you.
he risked his life when he killed the philistine.
the lord won a great victory for all israel.
you saw it, and you were happy.
why do you want to hurt david?
he’s innocent.
there is no reason to kill him.” 
saul listened to jonathan and made a promise.
he said, “as surely as the lord lives, david won’t be put to death.” 
so jonathan called david and told him everything that was said.
then jonathan brought david to saul, and david was with saul as before.
once again there was war with the philistines, and david went out to fight.
he defeated them badly, and they ran away.
later, in saul’s house, david was playing the harp.
saul was there with his spear in his hand.
then an evil spirit from the lord came on saul.
saul threw his spear at david and tried to pin him to the wall.
david jumped out of the way, so the spear missed him and stuck in the wall.
that night, david ran away.
saul sent men to watch david’s house.
they stayed there all night.
they were waiting to kill david in the morning, but david’s wife michal warned him.
she said, “you must run away tonight and save your life.
if you don’t, you will be killed tomorrow.” 
then michal let david down out of a window, and he escaped and ran away.
michal took the household god, put clothes on it, and put goats’ hair on its head.
then she put the statue in the bed.
saul sent messengers to take david prisoner.
but michal said, “david is sick.” 
the men went and told saul, but he sent the messengers back to see david.
saul told these men, “bring david to me.
bring him lying on his bed if you must, even if it kills him.” 
the messengers went to david’s house.
they went inside to get him, but they saw it was only a statue and that its hair was only goat’s hair.
saul said to michal, “why did you trick me like this?
you let my enemy escape, and now he is gone.” michal answered saul, “david told me he would kill me if i didn’t help him escape.” 
david escaped and ran away to samuel at ramah.
he told samuel everything that saul had done to him.
then david and samuel went to the camps where the prophets stayed.
david stayed there.
saul heard that david was there in the camps near ramah.
so he sent some men to arrest david.
but when they came to the camps, there was a group of prophets prophesying.
samuel was standing there leading the group.
the spirit of god came on saul’s messengers and they began prophesying.
saul heard about this, so he sent other messengers, but they also began prophesying.
so saul sent messengers a third time, and they also began prophesying.
finally, saul himself went to ramah.
saul came to the big well by the threshing floor at secu.
he asked, “where are samuel and david?” the people answered, “in the camps near ramah.” 
so saul went out to the camps near ramah.
the spirit of god came on saul, and he also began prophesying.
he prophesied all the way to the camps at ramah.
saul even took off his clothes.
he lay there naked all day and through the night.
so even saul prophesied there in front of samuel.
that is why people say, “is saul also one of the prophets?” 
ezekiel.
chapter 10.
then i looked up at the bowl over the heads of the cherub angels.
the bowl looked clear blue like sapphire, and there was something that looked like a throne over it.
then the one sitting on the throne said to the man dressed in linen clothes, “step into the area between the wheels under the cherub angels.
take a handful of the burning coals from between the cherub angels and go throw them over the city of jerusalem.” the man walked past me.
the cherub angels were standing in the area south of the temple as the man walked to them.
the cloud filled the inner courtyard.
then the glory of the lord rose up off the cherub angels near the threshold of the door of the temple.
then the cloud filled the temple, and the bright light from the glory of the lord filled the whole courtyard.
the noise from the wings of the cherub angels could be heard all the way out into the outer courtyard.
the sound was very loud—like the thundering voice when god all-powerful speaks.
god had given the man dressed in linen clothes a command.
he had told him to go into the area between the wheels among the cherub angels and get some hot coals.
so the man went there and stood by the wheel.
one of the cherub angels reached out his hand and took some of the hot coals from the area between the cherub angels.
he poured the coals into the man’s hands, and the man left.
(the cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings.)
then i noticed that there were four wheels.
there was one wheel by each cherub angel, and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel.
there were four wheels, and they all looked the same.
they looked like there was a wheel in a wheel.
they could go in any direction when they moved, but the cherub angels did not turn around when they moved.
they went in the direction that the head was looking.
they did not turn around when they moved.
there were eyes all over their bodies.
there were eyes on their backs, on their arms, on their wings, and on their wheels—on all four wheels!
these wheels were what i heard called, “the area between the wheels.” 
each cherub angel had four faces.
the first was the face of a cherub, the second was the face of a man, the third was a lion’s face, and the fourth was an eagle’s face.
(these cherub angels were the living beings i saw in the vision by the kebar canal.)
then the cherub angels rose into the air, 
and the wheels rose with them.
when the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air, not even the wheels turned around.
if they flew into the air, the wheels went with them.
if they stood still, so did the wheels, because the spirit of the living being was in them.
then the glory of the lord rose from the threshold of the temple, moved to the place over the cherub angels, and stopped there.
then the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air.
i saw them leave.
the wheels went with them.
then they stopped at the east gate of the lord’s temple.
the glory of the god of israel was in the air above them.
these were the living beings under the glory of the god of israel in the vision at the kebar canal, and now i realized that they were cherub angels.
each living being had four faces, four wings, and something that looked like human arms under their wings.
the faces of the cherub angels were the same as the four faces on the living beings in the vision by the kebar canal.
they all looked straight ahead in the direction they were going.
chapter 4.
adam had sexual relations with his wife eve.
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
she named him cain.
eve said, “with the lord’s help, i have made a man!” 
eve gave birth again to cain’s brother abel.
abel became a shepherd, and cain became a farmer.
at harvest time, cain brought a gift to the lord.
he brought some of the food that he grew from the ground, but abel brought some animals from his flock.
he chose some of his best sheep and brought the best parts from them.
the lord accepted abel and his gift.
but he did not accept cain and his offering.
cain was sad because of this, and he became very angry.
the lord asked cain, “why are you angry?
why does your face look sad?
you know that if you do what is right, i will accept you.
but if you don’t, sin is ready to attack you.
that sin will want to control you, but you must control it.” 
cain said to his brother abel, “let’s go out to the field.” so they went to the field.
then cain attacked his brother abel and killed him.
later, the lord said to cain, “where is your brother abel?” cain answered, “i don’t know.
is it my job to watch over my brother?” 
then the lord said, “what have you done?
you killed your brother and the ground opened up to take his blood from your hands.
now his blood is shouting to me from the ground.
so you will be cursed from this ground.
now when you work the soil, the ground will not help your plants grow.
you will not have a home in this land.
you will wander from place to place.” 
then cain said to the lord, “this punishment is more than i can bear!
you are forcing me to leave the land, and i will not be able to be near you or have a home!
now i must wander from place to place, and anyone i meet could kill me.” 
then the lord said to cain, “no, if anyone kills you, i will punish that person much, much more.” then the lord put a mark on cain to show that no one should kill him.
cain went away from the lord and lived in the land of nod.
cain had sexual relations with his wife.
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son named enoch.
cain built a city and gave the city the same name as his son enoch.
enoch had a son named irad.
irad had a son named mehujael.
mehujael had a son named methushael.
and methushael had a son named lamech.
lamech married two women.
one wife was named adah, and the other was named zillah.
adah gave birth to jabal.
jabal was the father of people who live in tents and earn their living by keeping cattle.
jabal was jubal’s brother.
jubal was the father of people who play the harp and flute.
zillah gave birth to tubal-cain.
tubal-cain was the father of people who work with bronze and iron.
the sister of tubal-cain was named naamah.
lamech said to his wives, “adah and zillah, hear my voice!
you wives of lamech, listen to me.
a man hurt me, so i killed him.
i even killed a child for hitting me.
the punishment for killing cain was very bad.
but the punishment for killing me will be many times worse!” 
adam again had sexual relations with his wife, and she gave birth to another son.
she named him seth.
eve said, “god has given me another son.
cain killed abel, but now i have seth.” 
seth also had a son.
he named him enosh.
at that time people began to pray to the lord.
chapter 4.
when sanballat heard that we were building the wall of jerusalem, he was very angry and upset.
he started making fun of the jews.
sanballat talked with his friends and the army at samaria and said, “what are these weak jews doing?
do they think we will leave them alone?
do they think they will offer sacrifices?
maybe they think they can finish building in only one day.
they cannot bring stones back to life from these piles of trash and dirt.
these are just piles of ashes and dirt!” 
tobiah the ammonite was with sanballat.
tobiah said, “what do these jews think they are building?
if even a small fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!” 
nehemiah prayed and said, “our god, listen to our prayer.
these men hate us.
sanballat and tobiah are insulting us.
make bad things happen to them.
make them ashamed, like people taken away as prisoners.
don’t take away their guilt or forgive the sins they have done in your sight.
they have insulted and discouraged the builders.” 
we built the wall of jerusalem all the way around the city.
but it was only half as tall as it should be.
we did this much because the people worked with all their heart.
but sanballat, tobiah, the arabs, the ammonites, and the men from ashdod were very angry.
they heard that the people continued working on the walls of jerusalem.
they heard the people were repairing the holes in the wall.
so all these men got together and made plans against jerusalem.
they planned to stir up trouble against jerusalem.
they planned to come and fight against the city.
but we prayed to our god.
and we put guards on the walls to watch day and night so that we could be ready to meet them.
and so at that time the people of judah said, “the workers are becoming tired.
there is too much dirt and trash in the way.
we cannot continue to build the wall.
and our enemies are saying, ‘before the jews know it or see us, we will be right there among them.
we will kill them and that will stop the work.’” 
then the jews living among our enemies came and said this to us ten times, “our enemies are all around us.
they are everywhere we turn.” 
so i put some of the people behind the lowest places along the wall, and i put them by the holes in the wall.
i put families together, with their swords, spears, and bows.
after looking over everything, i stood up and spoke to the important families, the officials, and the rest of the people.
i said, “don’t be afraid of our enemies.
remember the lord, who is great and powerful!
you must fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters!
you must fight for your wives and your homes!” 
then our enemies heard that we knew about their plans.
they knew that god ruined their plans.
so we all went back to work on the wall.
everyone went back to their own place and did their part.
from that day on, half of my men worked on the wall.
the other half of my men were on guard, ready with spears, shields, bows, and armor.
the army officers stood behind all the people of judah who were building the wall.
the builders and their helpers had their tools in one hand and a weapon in the other hand.
each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked.
the man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me.
then i spoke to the leading families, the officials, and the rest of the people.
i said, “this is a very big job and we are spread out along the wall.
we are far from one another.
so if you hear the trumpet, run to that place.
we will all meet together there, and our god will fight for us!” 
so we continued to work on the wall of jerusalem, and half the men held spears.
we worked from the first light of the morning until the stars came out at night.
at that time i also said this to the people, “every builder and his helper must stay inside jerusalem at night.
then they can be guards at night and workers during the day.” 
so none of us took off our clothes—not me, not my brothers, not my men, and not the guards.
each of us had our weapon ready at all times, even when we went to get water.

chapter 123.
a song for going up to the temple.
lord, i look up and pray to you.
you sit as king in heaven.
a slave looks to his master to provide what he needs, and a servant girl depends on the woman she serves.
so we depend on the lord our god, waiting for him to have mercy on us.
lord, be merciful to us, because we have been insulted much too long.
we have had enough of the hateful words of those proud people who make fun of us and show us no respect.
chapter 131.
a song of david for going up to the temple.
lord, i don’t feel proud.
i don’t see myself as better than others.
i am not thinking about doing great things or reaching impossible goals.
no, right now i am calm and quiet, like a child after nursing, content in its mother’s arms.
israel, trust in the lord.
trust in him now and forever!
chapter 125.
a song for going up to the temple.
those who trust in the lord are like mount zion.
they will never be shaken.
they will continue forever.
like the mountains that surround jerusalem, the lord surrounds and protects his people now and forever.
the wicked will not always control the land of those who do right.
if they did, even those who do right might start doing wrong.
lord, be good to those who are good, to those who have pure hearts.
but, lord, when you punish those who do evil, also punish those who have stopped following your way.
let israel always enjoy peace!
chapter 20.
one day some of the elders of israel came to me to ask the lord for advice.
this was on the tenth day of the fifth month of the seventh year of exile.
the elders sat down in front of me.
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, speak to the elders of israel.
tell them ‘this is what the lord god says: have you come to ask me what you should do?
i, the lord god, tell you that, as surely as i live, i will not listen to you.’ 
should you judge them?
will you judge them, son of man?
you must tell them about the terrible things their fathers have done.
you must tell them, ‘this is what the lord god says: on the day i chose israel, i raised my hand to jacob’s family and made a promise to them in egypt.
when i let them know who i was, i raised my hand and said, “i am the lord your god.” 
on that day i promised to take you out of egypt and lead you to the land i was giving to you.
that was a good land filled with many good things.
it was the most beautiful of all countries!
“‘i told the family of israel to throw away their horrible idols.
i told them not to become filthy with those filthy statues from egypt.
i said, “i am the lord your god.” 
but they turned against me and refused to listen to me.
they did not throw away their horrible idols.
they did not leave their filthy statues in egypt.
so i decided to destroy them in egypt—to let them feel the full force of my anger.
but i did not destroy them.
i had already told the egyptians that i would bring my people out of egypt.
i did not want to ruin my good name, so i did not destroy israel in front of those other people.
i brought the family of israel out of egypt.
i led them into the desert.
then i gave them my laws and told them all my rules.
all those who obey them will live.
i also told them about all the special days of rest, which were a special sign between us.
they showed that i am the lord and that i was making them special to me.
“‘but the family of israel turned against me in the desert.
they did not follow my laws.
they refused to obey my rules—even though people who obey my laws live because of them.
they treated my special days of rest as if they were not important.
they worked on those days many times.
i decided to destroy them in the desert—to let them feel the full force of my anger.
but i did not destroy them.
the other nations saw me bring israel out of egypt.
i did not want to ruin my good name, so i did not destroy israel in front of those other people.
i made another promise to those people in the desert.
i promised that i would not bring them into the land i was giving them.
that was a good land filled with many good things.
it was the most beautiful of all countries!
“‘the people of israel refused to obey my rules or to follow my laws.
they treated my days of rest as if they were not important.
they did all these things because their hearts belonged to their filthy idols.
but i felt sorry for them, so i did not destroy them.
i did not completely destroy them in the desert.
i spoke to their children and told them, “don’t be like your parents.
don’t make yourselves filthy with their filthy idols.
don’t follow their laws or obey their commands.
i am the lord.
i am your god.
obey my laws and keep my commands.
do the things i tell you.
show that my days of rest are important to you.
remember, they are a special sign between us.
i am the lord, and these days show you that i am your god.” 
“‘but the children turned against me and did not obey my laws.
they did not keep my commands—even though people who obey my laws live because of them.
they treated my special days of rest as though they were not important.
so i decided to destroy them completely in the desert—to let them feel the full force of my anger.
but i stopped myself.
the other nations saw me bring israel out of egypt.
i did not want to ruin my good name, so i did not destroy israel in front of those other people.
so i made another promise to those people in the desert.
i promised to scatter them among the nations, to send them to many different countries.
“‘the people of israel did not obey my commands.
they refused to obey my laws.
they treated my special days of rest as though they were not important, and they worshiped the filthy idols of their fathers.
so i gave them laws that were not good.
i gave them commands that would not bring life.
i let them make themselves filthy with their gifts.
they even began to sacrifice their own firstborn children.
in this way i would destroy them.
then they would know that i am the lord.’ 
so now, son of man, speak to the family of israel.
tell them, ‘this is what the lord god says: the people of israel said bad things about me and made evil plans against me.
but i still brought them to the land i promised to give them.
they saw all the hills and green trees, so they went to all those places to worship.
they took their sacrifices and anger offerings to all those places.
they offered their sacrifices that made a sweet smell, and they offered their drink offerings at those places.
i asked the people of israel why they were going to the high places.
but that high place is still there today.’ 
“since israel did those things, speak to them and tell them, ‘this is what the lord god says: you people have made yourselves filthy by doing the things your ancestors did.
you have acted like a prostitute.
you have left me to be with the horrible gods your ancestors worshiped.
you are giving the same kind of gifts.
you are putting your children in the fire as a gift to your false gods.
you are still making yourself filthy with these filthy idols today!
do you really think that i should let you come to me and ask me for advice?
i am the lord god.
by my life, i swear that i will not answer your questions or give you advice!
you keep saying you want to be like the other nations.
you live like the people in other nations.
you serve pieces of wood and stone idols!’” 
the lord god says, “by my life, i swear that i will rule over you as king.
but i will raise my powerful arm and punish you.
i will show my anger against you!
i will bring you out of these other nations.
i scattered you among these nations, but i will gather you together and bring you back from these countries.
but i will raise my powerful arm and punish you.
i will show my anger against you!
i will lead you into a desert as i did before, but this will be a place where other nations live.
we will stand face to face, and i will judge you.
i will judge you as i judged your ancestors in the desert near egypt.” this is what the lord god said.
“i will judge you guilty and punish you according to the agreement.
i will remove all those who turned against me and sinned against me.
i will remove them from your homeland.
they will never again come to the land of israel.
then you will know that i am the lord.” 
now, family of israel, this is what the lord god says: “whoever wants to worship their filthy idols, let them go and worship them.
but later, don’t think you will get any advice from me.
you will not ruin my name anymore—not when you continue to give your gifts to your filthy idols!” 
the lord god says, “people must come to my holy mountain—the high mountain in israel—to serve me!
the whole family of israel will be on their land; they will be there in their country.
there you can come to ask me for advice, and you must come there to bring me your offerings.
you must bring the first part of your crops to me there.
you must bring all your holy gifts to me in that place.
then i will be pleased with the sweet smell of your sacrifices.
that will happen when i bring you back.
i scattered you among many nations, but i will gather you together and make you my special people again.
and all the nations will see it.
then you will know that i am the lord.
you will know this when i bring you back to the land of israel, the land i promised to give to your ancestors.
in that country you will remember all the evil things you did that made you filthy, and you will be ashamed.
family of israel, you did many evil things, and you should be destroyed because of them.
but to protect my good name, i will not give you the punishment you really deserve.
then you will know that i am the lord.” this is what the lord god said.
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, look toward the negev, the southern part of judah.
speak against the negev forest.
say to the negev forest, ‘listen to the word of the lord.
this is what the lord god said: look, i am ready to start a fire in your forest.
the fire will destroy every green tree and every dry tree.
the flame that burns will not be put out.
all the land from south to north will be burned by the fire.
then all people will see that i, the lord, have started the fire.
the fire will not be put out!’” 
then i said, “oh, lord god!
if i say this, the people will say that i am only telling them stories.” 
2 chronicles.
chapter 9.
the queen of sheba heard about solomon, so she came to test him with hard questions.
she had a very large group with her.
she had camels that carried spices, much gold, and valuable stones.
she traveled to jerusalem with a very large group of servants.
there were many camels carrying spices, jewels, and a lot of gold.
she met solomon and asked him all the questions that she could think of.
solomon answered all the questions.
none of her questions was too hard for him to explain.
the queen of sheba saw that solomon was very wise.
she also saw the beautiful palace he had built.
she saw the food at the king’s table.
she saw his officials meeting together.
she saw the servants in the palace and the good clothes they wore.
she saw his parties and the sacrifices that he offered in the lord’s temple.
she was so amazed, she could hardly breathe!
then she said to king solomon, “the stories i heard in my country about your great works and your wisdom are true.
i did not believe it until i came and saw it with my own eyes.
now i see that it is even greater than what i heard.
your wealth and wisdom is much greater than people told me.
your wives and officers are very fortunate!
they can serve you and hear your wisdom every day.
praise the lord your god!
he was pleased to make you king of israel.
the lord god loves israel, so he made you the king.
you follow the law and treat people fairly.” 
then the queen of sheba gave king solomon 4 1/2 tons of gold, a huge amount of spices, and precious stones.
she gave solomon more spices than anyone has ever brought into israel.
hiram’s servants brought gold from ophir.
they also brought in jewels and a special kind of wood.
king solomon used this special wood to make steps for the lord’s temple and the king’s palace.
solomon also used the algum wood to make lyres and harps for the singers.
no one ever saw such beautiful things like those made from the algum wood in the country of judah.
king solomon gave the queen of sheba everything she asked for.
he gave her more than she brought to give him.
then the queen of sheba and her servants left and went back to their own country.
every year solomon got almost 25 tons of gold.
in addition to the gold brought in by the traveling merchants and traders, all the kings of arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver to solomon.
king solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold.
he used about 15 pounds of gold for each shield.
he also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold.
he used about 7 1/2 pounds of gold for each shield.
the king put them in the forest-of-lebanon house.
king solomon also built a large throne with ivory decorations.
it was covered with pure gold.
there were six steps leading up to the throne.
the back of the throne was round at the top.
there were armrests on both sides of the throne, and there were lions in the sides of the throne under the armrests.
there were also two lions on each of the six steps, one at each end.
there was nothing like it in any other kingdom.
all of solomon’s cups and glasses were made of gold.
and all the dishes in the building called the “forest of lebanon” were made from pure gold.
nothing in the palace was made from silver.
there was so much gold that in solomon’s time people did not think silver was important!
the king also had cargo ships that went to tarshish to trade things with other countries.
hiram’s men were on these ships.
every three years the ships would come back with a new load of gold, silver, ivory, and apes and baboons.
king solomon became greater in riches and wisdom than any other king on earth.
people everywhere wanted to see king solomon.
they wanted to hear the great wisdom that god had given him.
every year people came to see the king, and everyone brought a gift.
they brought things made from gold and silver, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
solomon had 4000 stalls to keep horses and chariots.
he had 12,000 horse soldiers.
solomon built special cities for these chariots.
so the chariots were kept in these cities.
king solomon also kept some of the chariots with him in jerusalem.
solomon was the king over all the kings from the euphrates river all the way to the land of the philistines, and to the border of egypt.
king solomon had so much silver that it was as common as rocks in jerusalem.
and he had so much cedar wood that it was as common as sycamore trees in the hill country.
the people brought horses to solomon from egypt and from all the other countries.
everything else solomon did, from the beginning to the end, is written in the writings of nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of ahijah from shiloh, and in the visions of iddo the seer.
iddo was a seer who wrote about jeroboam son of nebat.
solomon ruled in jerusalem over all israel for 40 years.
then he died and was buried in the city of david, his father.
then solomon’s son rehoboam became the next king.
2 kings.
chapter 25.
so king nebuchadnezzar of babylon and all his army came to fight against jerusalem.
this happened on the 10th day of the tenth month of zedekiah’s ninth year as king.
nebuchadnezzar put his army around jerusalem to stop people from going in and out of the city.
then he built a wall of dirt around the city.
his army stayed around jerusalem until zedekiah’s eleventh year as king of judah.
the famine was getting worse and worse in the city.
by the 9th day of the fourth month, there was no more food for the common people in the city.
nebuchadnezzar’s army finally broke through the city wall.
that night king zedekiah and all his soldiers ran away.
they used the secret gate that went through the double walls.
it was by the king’s garden.
the enemy soldiers were all around the city, but zedekiah and his men escaped on the road to the desert.
the babylonian army chased king zedekiah and caught him near jericho.
all of zedekiah’s soldiers left him and ran away.
the babylonians took king zedekiah to the king of babylon at riblah.
the babylonians decided to punish zedekiah.
they killed zedekiah’s sons in front of him.
then they put out zedekiah’s eyes.
they put chains on him and took him to babylon.
nebuchadnezzar came to jerusalem on the 7th day of the fifth month of his nineteenth year as king of babylon.
the captain of nebuchadnezzar’s best soldiers was nebuzaradan.
nebuzaradan burned the lord’s temple, the king’s palace, and all the houses in jerusalem.
he destroyed even the largest houses.
then the babylonian army that was with nebuzaradan pulled down the walls around jerusalem.
nebuzaradan captured all the people who were still left in the city.
he took all the people as prisoners, even those who had tried to surrender.
he let only the poorest of the common people stay there.
he let them stay so that they could take care of the grapes and other crops.
the babylonian soldiers broke into pieces all the bronze things in the lord’s temple.
they broke the bronze columns, the bronze carts, and the large bronze tank that were in the lord’s temple.
then they took all of that bronze to babylon.
the babylonians also took the pots, the shovels, the tools for trimming the lamps, the spoons, and all the bronze dishes that were used in the temple.
nebuzaradan took all the firepans and bowls.
he took all the things made of gold for the gold.
and he took everything made of silver for the silver.
so nebuzaradan took the large bronze tank and the 2 bronze columns.
(each column was about 31 feet tall.
the capitals on the columns were over 5 feet tall.
they were made from bronze and had a design like a net and pomegranates.
both columns had the same kind of design.)
he also took the carts that solomon made for the lord’s temple.
the bronze from these things was too heavy to be weighed.
from the temple, nebuzaradan took seraiah the high priest, zephaniah the second priest, and the three men who guarded the entrance.
from the city nebuzaradan took one official who was in charge of the army and five of the king’s advisors who were still in the city.
he took one secretary of the commander of the army who was in charge of counting the common people and choosing some of them to be soldiers and 60 people who just happened to be in the city.
then nebuzaradan took all these people to the king of babylon at riblah in the area of hamath.
the king of babylon killed them there at riblah.
and the people of judah were led away as prisoners from their land.
king nebuchadnezzar of babylon left some people in the land of judah.
there was a man named gedaliah son of ahikam son of shaphan.
nebuchadnezzar made gedaliah governor over the people in judah.
the army captains were ishmael son of nethaniah, johanan son of kareah, seraiah son of tanhumeth from netophah, and jaazaniah son of the maachathite.
these army captains and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor, so they went to mizpah to meet with him.
gedaliah made promises to these officers and their men.
he said to them, “don’t be afraid of the babylonian officers.
stay here and serve the king of babylon.
then everything will be all right with you.” 
ishmael son of nethaniah son of elishama was from the king’s family.
in the seventh month, ishmael and ten of his men attacked gedaliah and killed all the men of judah and babylonians who were with gedaliah at mizpah.
then the army officers and all the people ran away to egypt.
everyone, from the least important to the most important, ran away because they were afraid of the babylonians.
later, evil merodach became the king of babylon.
he let king jehoiachin of judah out of prison.
this happened in the 37th year after jehoiachin was captured.
this was on the 27th day of the twelfth month from the time that evil merodach began to rule.
evil merodach was kind to jehoiachin.
he gave him a more important place to sit than the other kings who were with him in babylon.
evil merodach let jehoiachin stop wearing prison clothes.
and every day for the rest of his life, he ate at the same table with the king.
and each day, for as long as jehoiachin lived, the king gave him enough money to pay for whatever he needed.
chapter 142.
a maskil of david written when he was in the cave.
a prayer.
i cry out to the lord.
i beg the lord to help me.
i tell him my problems; i tell him about my troubles.
i am ready to give up.
but you, lord, know the path i am on, and you know that my enemies have set a trap for me.
i look around, and i don’t see anyone i know.
i have no place to run.
there is no one to save me.
lord, i cry out to you for help: “you are my place of safety.
you are all i need in life.” 
listen to my prayer.
i am so weak.
save me from those who are chasing me.
they are stronger than i am.

you are famous, and doing what you promised will make you even more famous!
when i called to you for help, you answered me and gave me strength.
lord, all the kings on earth will praise you when they hear what you say.
they will sing about what the lord has done, because the glory of the lord is very great.
the lord has the highest place above all others, but he still cares for the humble.
even from there, so high above, he knows what the proud do.
if i am in trouble, you keep me alive.
if my enemies are angry, you save me from them.

let them be chased by the lord’s angel.
make their road dark and slippery.
let the lord’s angel chase them.
i did nothing wrong, but they tried to trap me.
for no reason at all, they dug a pit to catch me.
so let them fall into their own traps.
let them stumble into their own nets.
let some unknown danger catch them.
then i will rejoice in the lord.
i will be happy when he saves me.
with my whole self i will say, “lord, there is no one like you.
you protect the poor from those who are stronger.
you save the poor and helpless from those who try to rob them.” 
there are witnesses trying to harm me.
they ask me questions that i know nothing about.
they pay me back evil for the good i have done.
they make me so very sad.
when they were sick, i was sad and wore sackcloth.
i went without eating to show my sorrow.
(may my prayers for them not be answered!)
i mourned for them as i would for a friend or a brother.
i bowed low with sadness, crying as i would for my own mother.
but when i had troubles, they laughed at me.
they were not really friends.
i was surrounded and attacked by people i didn’t even know.
they made fun of me, using the worst language.
they ground their teeth to show their anger.
my lord, how long will you watch this happen?
save my life from these people who are attacking me like lions and trying to destroy me.
i will praise you in the great assembly.
i will praise you there among the crowds.
don’t let my lying enemies keep on laughing at me.
they have no reason to hate me.
surely they will be punished for their secret plans.
they have no friendly words for others, but plan ways to hurt those who want to live in peace.
they are telling lies about me.
they say, “aha!
we know what you did!” 
lord, surely you can see what is happening.
so don’t keep quiet.
lord, don’t leave me.
wake up!
get up!
my god and my lord, fight for me, and bring me justice.
lord my god, judge me with your fairness.
don’t let those people laugh at me.
don’t let them think, “aha!
we got what we wanted!” don’t let them say, “we destroyed him!” 
let my enemies be ashamed and embarrassed— all those who were happy about my troubles.
proud of themselves, they treated me as worthless.
so let them be covered with shame and disgrace.
to those who want the best for me, i wish them joy and happiness.
may they always say, “praise the lord, who wants what is best for his servant.” 
so, lord, i will tell people how good you are.
i will praise you all day long.
chapter 29.
job continued to speak: 
“i wish my life could be the same as it was a few months ago, when god watched over me and cared for me.
god’s light shined above me, so i could walk through the darkness.
i wish for the days when i was successful, when i enjoyed god’s friendship and blessing in my home.
god all-powerful was still with me then, and my children were all around me.
life was so good that i washed my feet in cream and had plenty of the finest oils.
“those were the days when i went to the city gate and sat in the public meeting of the elders.
when the young men saw me coming, they stepped out of my way.
and the old men stood up to show they respected me.
the leaders of the people stopped talking and put their hands over their mouths.
even the most important leaders were quiet, as if their tongues were stuck to the roof of their mouths.
all who heard me said good things about me.
those who saw what i did praised me, 
because i helped the poor when they cried out.
i helped the orphans who had no one to care for them.
people who were dying asked god to bless me.
my help brought joy to widows in need.
right living was my clothing.
fairness was my robe and turban.
i was like eyes for the blind, like feet for the crippled.
i was like a father to the poor.
i helped people i didn’t even know win their case in court.
i stopped evil people from abusing their power and saved innocent people from them.
“i always thought i would live a long life, growing old with my family around me.
i was like a healthy plant with roots that have plenty of water and branches that are wet with dew.
i thought each new day would bring more honor and be full of new possibilities.
“in the past people listened to me.
they waited quietly for my advice.
when i finished speaking, they had nothing more to say.
my words fell gently on their ears.
they waited for my words as they would for rain.
they drank them in like rain in the springtime.
i smiled at them, and they could hardly believe it.
my smile made them feel better.
i was their leader and made decisions about their future.
i was like a king among his troops, comforting those who were sad.
2 kings.
chapter 1.
after king ahab died, moab broke away from israel’s rule.
one day ahaziah was on the roof of his house in samaria.
he fell down through the wooden bars on top of his house and was badly hurt.
he called messengers and told them, “go to the priests of baal zebub, the god of ekron, and ask them if i will get well from my injuries.” 
but the lord’s angel said to elijah the tishbite, “king ahaziah has sent some messengers from samaria.
go meet those men and ask them, ‘there is a god in israel, so why are you men going to ask questions of baal zebub, the god of ekron?
since you did this, the lord says, you will not get up from your bed.
you will die!’” then elijah left.
when messengers came back to ahaziah, he asked them, “why did you come back so soon?” 
the messengers said to ahaziah, “a man came up to meet us and told us to go back to the king who sent us and tell him what the lord says: ‘there is a god in israel, so why did you send messengers to ask questions of baal zebub, the god of ekron?
since you did this, you will not get up from your bed.
you will die!’” 
ahaziah said to the messengers, “what did the man look like who met you and told you this?” 
they answered ahaziah, “this man was wearing a hairy coat with a leather belt around his waist.” then ahaziah said, “that was elijah the tishbite.” 
ahaziah sent a captain and 50 men to elijah.
the captain went to elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill.
the captain said to elijah, “man of god, the king says, ‘come down!’” 
elijah answered the captain of 50, “if i am a man of god, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your 50 men!” so fire came down from heaven and destroyed the captain and his 50 men.
ahaziah sent another captain with 50 men to elijah.
he said to elijah, “man of god, the king says, ‘come down quickly!’” 
elijah told the captain and his 50 men, “if i am a man of god, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your 50 men!” then god’s fire came down from heaven and destroyed the captain and his 50 men.
ahaziah sent a third captain with 50 men.
the third captain came to elijah.
he fell down on his knees and begged elijah, saying to him, “man of god, i ask you, please let my life and the lives of your 50 servants be valuable to you.
fire came down from heaven and destroyed the first two captains and their 50 men.
but now, have mercy and let us live!” 
the lord’s angel said to elijah, “go with the captain.
don’t be afraid of him.” so elijah went with the captain to see king ahaziah.
elijah told ahaziah, “this is what the lord says: ‘there is a god in israel, so why did you send messengers to ask questions of baal zebub, the god of ekron?
since you did this, you will not get up from your bed.
you will die!’” 
ahaziah died, just as the lord said through elijah.
ahaziah did not have a son, so joram became the new king after ahaziah.
he began to rule during the second year that jehoram son of jehoshaphat was the king of judah.
the other things that ahaziah did are written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
chapter 13.
when joshua was very old, the lord said to him, “joshua you have grown old, but there is still much land for you to take control of.
you have not yet taken the land of geshur or the land of the philistines.
you have not yet taken the area from the shihor river at egypt to the border of ekron and the land further north.
that land still belongs to the canaanites.
you must still defeat the five philistine leaders at gaza, ashdod, ashkelon, gath, and ekron.
you must also defeat the avvites 
who live south of the canaanite land.
and you must still go north to take mearah, which the sidonians control.
from there you must still go as far as aphek on the amorite border.
you have not yet defeated the area of the gebalites.
and also there is the area of lebanon east of baal gad below mount hermon to lebo hamath.
“the people of sidon are living in the hill country from lebanon to misrephoth maim.
but i will force them out for the israelites.
be sure to remember this land when you divide the land among the israelites.
do this as i told you.
now divide the land among the nine tribes and half the tribe of manasseh.” 
the tribes of reuben, gad, and the other half of the tribe of manasseh had already received all their land.
the lord’s servant, moses, gave them the land east of the jordan river.
their land started at aroer by the arnon ravine and continued to the town in the middle of the ravine.
and it included the whole plain from medeba to dibon.
all the towns that king sihon of the amorites ruled were in that land.
he ruled in the city of heshbon.
the land continued to the area where the ammonites lived.
also the town of gilead was in that land.
and the area where the people of geshur and maacah lived was in that land.
all of mount hermon and all of bashan as far as salecah was in that land.
all the kingdom of king og was in that land.
king og ruled in bashan.
in the past he ruled in ashtaroth and edrei.
og was from the rephaites.
in the past moses had defeated those people and had taken their land.
the israelites did not force out the people of geshur and maacah.
they still live among the israelites today.
the tribe of levi is the only tribe that did not get any land.
instead, the levites were given all the animals offered by fire to the lord, the god of israel.
that is what the lord promised them.
moses had given each family group from the tribe of reuben some land.
this is the land they received: 
it was the land from aroer near the arnon ravine to the town of medeba.
this included the whole plain and the town in the middle of the ravine.
the land continued to heshbon.
it included all the towns on the plain.
those towns were dibon, bamoth baal, beth baal meon, 
jahaz, kedemoth, mephaath, 
kiriathaim, sibmah, zereth shahar on the hill in the valley, 
beth peor, the hills of pisgah, and beth jeshimoth.
so that land included all the towns on the plain and all the area that king sihon of the amorites had ruled.
he ruled in the town of heshbon, but moses had defeated him and the leaders of the midianites.
those leaders were evi, rekem, zur, hur, and reba.
(they all fought together with sihon.)
all of them lived in that country.
the israelites defeated balaam son of beor.
(balaam tried to use magic to tell the future.)
the israelites killed many people during the fighting.
the land that was given to reuben stopped at the shore of the jordan river.
so the land that was given to the family groups of reuben included all these towns and their fields that were listed.
this is the land moses gave to the tribe of gad.
he gave this land to each tribe: 
he gave them the land of jazer, all the towns of gilead, and half of the land of the ammonites that went as far as aroer near rabbah.
their land included the area from heshbon to ramath mizpah and betonim, from mahanaim to the land of debir, 
the valley of beth haram, beth nimrah, succoth and zaphon, including the rest of the kingdom of king sihon of heshbon, along the jordan all the way up to lake galilee on the eastern side of the river.
all this land is the land moses gave the family groups of gad.
that land included all the towns that were listed.
moses gave that land to each family group.
this is the land moses gave to half the tribe of manasseh.
half of all the families in the tribe of manasseh got this land: 
the land started at mahanaim.
the land included all of bashan, all the land ruled by king og of bashan, and all the towns of jair in bashan.
(in all, there were 60 cities.)
the land also included half of gilead, ashtaroth, and edrei.
(gilead, ashtaroth, and edrei were the cities where king og had lived.)
all this land was given to the family of makir son of manasseh.
half of all his sons got this land.
moses gave all this land to these tribes.
he did this while the people were camped on the plains of moab.
this was across the jordan river, east of jericho.
moses did not give any land to the tribe of levi.
the lord, god of israel, promised that he himself would be the gift for the tribe of levi.
chapter 20.
abraham left that place and traveled to the negev.
he settled in the city of gerar, between kadesh and shur.
while in gerar, 
abraham told people that sarah was his sister.
king abimelech of gerar heard this.
abimelech wanted sarah, so he sent some servants to take her.
but one night god spoke to abimelech in a dream and said, “you will die.
the woman you took is married.” 
but abimelech had not yet slept with sarah, so he said, “lord, i am not guilty.
would you kill an innocent man?
abraham himself told me, ‘this woman is my sister,’ and she also said, ‘this man is my brother.’ i am innocent.
i did not know what i was doing.” 
then god said to abimelech in a dream, “yes, i know that you are innocent and that you did not know what you were doing.
i saved you.
i did not allow you to sin against me.
i was the one who did not allow you to sleep with her.
so give abraham his wife again.
he is a prophet.
he will pray for you, and you will live.
but if you don’t give sarah back to him, i promise that you will die.
and all your family will die with you.” 
so very early the next morning, abimelech called all his servants and told them about the dream.
the servants were very afraid.
then abimelech called abraham and said to him, “why have you done this to us?
what wrong did i do to you?
why did you lie and say that she was your sister?
you brought great trouble to my kingdom.
you should not have done this to me.
what were you afraid of?
why did you do this to me?” 
then abraham said, “i thought no one in this place respected god.
i thought someone would kill me to get sarah.
she is my wife, but she is also my sister.
she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother.
god led me away from my father’s house.
he led me to wander to many different places.
when that happened, i told sarah, ‘do something for me.
wherever we go, tell people you are my sister.’” 
so abimelech gave sarah back to abraham.
abimelech also gave abraham some sheep, cattle, and slaves.
and abimelech said, “look all around you.
this is my land.
you may live any place you want.” 
abimelech said to sarah, “i gave your brother abraham 1000 pieces of silver.
i did this to show that i am very sorry.
i want everyone to see that i did the right thing.” 
the lord made all the women in abimelech’s family not able to have children.
god did this because abimelech had taken sarah, abraham’s wife.
but abraham prayed to god, and god healed abimelech, his wife, and his servant girls.
chapter 19.
it is better to be poor and honest than to be a liar and a fool.
being excited about something is not enough.
you must also know what you are doing.
don’t rush into something, or you might do it wrong.
people ruin their lives with the foolish things they do, and then they blame the lord for it.
wealth will bring you many friends, but become poor and your friends will leave you.
a witness who lies will be punished; that liar will not escape.
many people are nice to a generous person.
everyone wants to be friends with someone who gives gifts.
if you are poor, your family will turn against you, and your friends will avoid you even more.
you might beg them for help, but no one will come to help you.
be a friend to yourself; do all you can to be wise.
try hard to understand, and you will be rewarded.
a witness who lies will be punished.
that liar will be destroyed.
a fool should not be rich, and a slave should not rule over princes.
experience makes you more patient, and you are most patient when you ignore insults.
the shouts of an angry king are like a roaring lion, but his kind words are like a gentle rain falling softly on the grass.
a foolish son brings a flood of troubles to his father, and a complaining wife is like the constant dripping of water.
people receive houses and money from their parents, but a good wife is a gift from the lord.
laziness brings on sleep, and an appetite for rest brings on hunger.
obey the law and live; ignore it and die.
giving help to the poor is like loaning money to the lord.
he will pay you back for your kindness.
discipline your children while there is still hope.
avoiding it can be deadly.
people who are quick to become angry must pay the price.
protect them from punishment, and they become worse.
listen to advice and accept discipline; then you, too, will become wise.
people might make many plans, but what the lord says is what will happen.
people want a friend they can trust.
it is better to be poor than to be a liar.
respect the lord and you will have a good life, one that is satisfying and free from trouble.
some people are too lazy to take care of themselves.
they will not even lift the food from their plate to their mouth.
punish a rude, arrogant person, and even slow learners will become wiser.
but just a little correction is enough to teach a person who has understanding.
those who would steal from their father and chase away their mother are disgusting, shameful people.
my son, if you stop listening to instructions, you will keep making stupid mistakes.
using a criminal as a witness makes a joke of justice.
people like that only want to do wrong.
people who show no respect for anything must be brought to justice.
you must punish such fools.
chapter 51.
to the director: a song of david written when nathan the prophet came to him after david’s sin with bathsheba.
god, be merciful to me because of your faithful love.
because of your great compassion, erase all the wrongs i have done.
scrub away my guilt.
wash me clean from my sin.
i know i have done wrong.
i remember that sin all the time.
i did what you said is wrong.
you are the one i have sinned against.
i say this so that people will know that i am wrong and you are right.
what you decided is fair.
i was born to do wrong, a sinner before i left my mother’s womb.
you want me to be completely loyal, so put true wisdom deep inside of me.
remove my sin and make me pure.
wash me until i am whiter than snow!
let me hear sounds of joy and happiness again.
let the bones you crushed be happy again.
don’t look at my sins.
erase them all.
god, create a pure heart in me, and make my spirit strong again.
don’t push me away or take your holy spirit from me.
your help made me so happy.
give me that joy again.
make my spirit strong and ready to obey you.
i will teach the guilty how you want them to live, and the sinners will come back to you.
god, spare me from the punishment of death.
my god, you are the one who saves me!
let me sing about all the good things you do for me!
my lord, i will open my mouth and sing your praises!
you don’t really want sacrifices, or i would give them to you.
the sacrifice that god wants is a humble spirit.
god, you will not turn away someone who comes with a humble heart and is willing to obey you.
god, please be good to zion.
rebuild the walls of jerusalem.
then you can enjoy the kind of sacrifices you want.
you will receive whole burnt offerings, and people will again offer bulls on your altar.
chapter 32.
a maskil of david.
it is a great blessing when people are forgiven for the wrongs they have done, when their sins are erased.
it is a great blessing when the lord says they are not guilty, when they don’t try to hide their sins.
lord, i prayed to you again and again, but i did not talk about my sins.
so i only became weaker and more miserable.
every day you made life harder for me.
i became like a dry land in the hot summertime.
selah 
but then i decided to confess my sins to the lord.
i stopped hiding my guilt and told you about my sins.
and you forgave them all!
selah 
that is why your loyal followers pray to you while there is still time.
then when trouble rises like a flood, it will not reach them.
you are a hiding place for me.
you protect me from my troubles.
you surround me and protect me, so i sing about the way you saved me.
selah 
the lord says, “i will teach you and guide you in the way you should live.
i will watch over you and be your guide.
don’t be like a stupid horse or mule that will not come to you unless you put a bit in its mouth and pull it with reins.” 
many pains will come to the wicked, but the lord’s faithful love will surround those who trust in him.
good people, rejoice and be very happy in the lord.
all you who want to do right, rejoice!
chapter 87.
a song of praise from the korah family.
the lord built his city on the holy hills.
he loves the gates of zion more than any other place in israel.
wonderful things are said about you, city of god.
selah 
god says, “some of my people live in egypt and babylon.
some of them were born in philistia, tyre, and even ethiopia.” 
but about zion he says, “i know each and every person born there.” it is the city built by god most high.
the lord keeps a list of all his people, and he knows where each of them was born.
selah 
at the festivals, people will dance and sing, “all good things come from zion.” 
deuteronomy.
chapter 6.
“these are the commands, the laws, and the rules that the lord your god told me to teach you.
obey these laws in the land that you are entering to live in.
you and your descendants must respect the lord your god as long as you live.
you must obey all his laws and commands that i give you.
if you do this, you will have a long life in that new land.
israelites, listen carefully and obey these laws.
then everything will be fine with you.
you will have many children, and you will get the land filled with many good things—just as the lord, the god of your ancestors, promised.
“listen, people of israel!
the lord is our god.
the lord is the only god.
you must love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength.
always remember these commands that i give you today.
be sure to teach them to your children.
talk about these commands when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road.
talk about them when you lie down and when you get up.
tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads to help you remember my teachings.
write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates.
“the lord your god made a promise to your ancestors, abraham, isaac, and jacob.
he promised to give you this land, and he will give it to you.
he will give you great and rich cities that you did not build.
he will give you houses full of good things that you did not put there.
he will give you wells that you did not dig.
he will give you vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant, and you will have plenty to eat.
“but be careful!
don’t forget the lord.
you were slaves in egypt, but he brought you out of the land of egypt.
respect the lord your god and serve only him.
you must use only his name to make promises.
you must not follow other gods.
you must not follow the gods of the people who live around you.
the lord your god is always with you, and he hates for his people to worship other gods!
so if you follow those other gods, the lord will become very angry with you.
he will destroy you from the face of the earth.
“you must not test the lord your god like you tested him at massah.
you must be sure to obey the commands of the lord your god.
you must follow all the teachings and laws he has given you.
you must do what is right and good—what pleases the lord.
then everything will go well for you, and you can go in and take the good land that the lord promised your ancestors.
and you will force out all your enemies, just as the lord said.
“in the future, your children might ask you, ‘the lord our god gave you teachings, laws, and rules.
what do they mean?’ 
then you will say to them, ‘we were pharaoh’s slaves in egypt, but the lord brought us out of egypt with his great power.
the lord did great and amazing things.
we saw him do these things to the egyptian people, to pharaoh, and to the people in pharaoh’s house.
he brought us out of egypt so that he could give us the land that he promised our ancestors.
the lord commanded us to follow all these teachings.
we must respect the lord our god.
then he will always keep us alive and doing well, as we are today.
if we carefully obey the whole law, exactly as the lord our god told us to, he will say that we have done a very good thing.’ 
genesis.
chapter 42.
during the famine in canaan, jacob learned that there was grain in egypt.
so he said to his sons, “why are you sitting here doing nothing?
i have heard that there is grain for sale in egypt.
go there and buy grain for us so that we will live and not die!” 
so ten of joseph’s brothers went to egypt to buy grain.
jacob did not send benjamin.
(benjamin was joseph’s only full brother.)
jacob was afraid that something bad might happen to benjamin.
the famine was very bad in canaan, so there were many people from canaan who went to egypt to buy grain.
among them were the sons of israel.
joseph was the governor of egypt at the time.
he was the one who checked the sale of grain to people who came to egypt to buy it.
joseph’s brothers came to him and bowed before him.
joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like he didn’t know them.
he was rude when he spoke to them.
he said, “where do you come from?” the brothers answered, “we have come from the land of canaan to buy food.” 
joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not know who he was.
then joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about his brothers.
joseph said to his brothers, “you have not come to buy food!
you are spies.
you came to learn where we are weak.” 
but the brothers said to him, “no, sir, we come as your servants.
we have come only to buy food.
we are all brothers—we all have the same father.
we are honest men.
we have come only to buy food.” 
then joseph said to them, “no, you have come to spy on us!” 
and the brothers said, “no, sir, we come as servants from canaan.
we are all brothers, sons of the same father.
there were twelve brothers in our family.
our youngest brother is still at home with our father, and the other brother died a long time ago.” 
but joseph said to them, “no!
i can see that i am right.
you are spies.
but i will let you prove that you are telling the truth.
in the name of pharaoh, i swear that i will not let you go until your youngest brother comes here.
one of you must go back to get your youngest brother while the rest of you stay here in prison.
then we can prove whether you are telling the truth or not.
if you are not telling the truth, then by pharaoh, i swear that you are spies!” 
then joseph put them all in prison for three days.
after three days joseph said to them, “i am a god-fearing man.
do this, and i will let you live.
if you are honest men, one of your brothers can stay here in prison, and the others can go and carry grain back to your people.
but then you must bring your youngest brother back here to me.
then i will know that you are telling the truth, and you will not have to die.” the brothers agreed to this.
they said to each other, “we are being punished for the bad thing we did to our younger brother joseph.
we saw the trouble he was in.
he begged us to save him, but we refused to listen.
so now we are in trouble.” 
then reuben said to them, “i told you not to do anything bad to that boy, but you refused to listen to me.
now we are being punished for his death.” 
joseph was using an interpreter to talk to his brothers, so the brothers did not know that he understood their language.
he heard and understood everything they said, and that made him want to cry.
so he turned away and left the room.
when he came back, he took one of the brothers, simeon, and tied him up while the others watched.
joseph told the servants to fill the bags with grain.
the brothers had given joseph the money for the grain, but he didn’t keep the money.
he put the money in their bags of grain.
then he gave them what they would need for their trip back home.
so the brothers put the grain on their donkeys and left.
that night the brothers stopped at a place to spend the night.
one of the brothers opened his sack to get some grain for his donkey.
and there in the sack, he saw his money!
he said to the other brothers, “look!
here is the money i paid for the grain.
someone put the money back in my sack.” the brothers were very afraid.
they said to one another, “what is god doing to us?” 
the brothers went back to their father jacob in the land of canaan.
they told him about everything that had happened.
they said, “the governor of that country spoke rudely to us.
he thought that we were spies!
we told him, ‘we are honest men, not spies.
there are twelve of us brothers, all from the same father.
but one of our brothers is no longer living, and the youngest is still at home with our father in canaan.’ 
“then the governor of that country said to us, ‘here is a way to prove that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me.
take your grain back to your families.
bring your youngest brother to me.
then i will know if you are honest men or if you were sent from an army to destroy us.
if you are telling the truth, i will give your brother back to you.
i will give him to you, and you will be free to buy grain in our country.’” 
then the brothers started taking the grain out of their sacks, and every brother found his bag of money in his sack of grain.
when the brothers and their father saw the money, they were afraid.
jacob said to them, “do you want me to lose all of my children?
joseph is gone.
simeon is gone, and now you want to take benjamin away too!” 
but reuben said to his father, “father, you may kill my two sons if i don’t bring benjamin back to you.
trust me.
i will bring him back to you.” 
but jacob said, “i will not let benjamin go with you.
his brother is dead, and he is the only son left from my wife rachel.
it would kill me if anything happened to him during the trip to egypt.
you would send me to the grave a very sad, old man.” 
micah.
chapter 1.
during the time that jotham, ahaz, and hezekiah were kings of judah, the word of the lord came to micah.
micah was from moresheth.
he saw these visions about samaria and jerusalem.
listen, all you people!
earth and everyone on it, listen!
the lord god will be a witness against you.
the lord will come from his holy temple.
see, the lord is leaving his place to come down and walk on the high places of the earth.
the mountains will melt under him like wax in a fire.
the valleys will break apart and slide like water rushing down a hill.
this will happen because of jacob’s sin, because of the sins of the nation of israel.
what caused jacob to sin?
it was samaria.
where is the high place in judah?
it is jerusalem.
so i will change samaria into a pile of rocks in the field, a place ready for planting grapes.
i will push samaria’s stones down into the valley, leaving nothing but the foundations.
all her idols will be broken to pieces.
and the offerings to her idols will be burned.
i will destroy all her statues of false gods, because she got them as pay for being a prostitute.
so those things will be taken away to be used again for paying prostitutes.
i will be very sad about what will happen.
i will go without sandals and clothes.
i will cry like a dog.
i will mourn like a bird.
samaria’s wound cannot be healed.
her disease has spread to judah.
it has reached the city gate of my people; it has spread all the way to jerusalem.
don’t tell it in gath.
don’t cry in acco.
roll yourself in the dust at beth ophrah.
you people living in shaphir, pass on your way, naked and ashamed.
the people living in zaanan will not come out.
the people in beth ezel will cry and take their support from you.
the people living in maroth wait for something good to happen, even though trouble has come down from the lord and has reached the city gate of jerusalem.
you people living in lachish, get the horses ready for your chariots.
you are guilty of the same sins israel committed, and you brought those sins to jerusalem.
so you must give goodbye gifts to moresheth in gath.
the houses in aczib will trick the kings of israel.
you people who live in mareshah, i will bring someone against you who will take the things you own.
the glory of israel will come into adullam.
so cut off your hair, make yourself bald, because you will cry for the children you love.
make yourself bald like an eagle and show your sadness, because your children will be taken away from you.
chapter 58.
to the director: to the tune “don’t destroy.” a miktam of david.
you judges are not being fair in your decisions.
you are not judging people fairly.
no, you only think of evil things to do.
you do violent crimes in this country.
those wicked people started doing wrong as soon as they were born.
they have been liars from birth.
their anger is as deadly as the poison of a snake.
they shut their ears like a deaf cobra 
that does not listen to the music of the snake charmers, no matter how well they play.
god, they are like lions.
so lord, break their teeth.
may they disappear like water down a drain.
may they be crushed like weeds on a path.
may they be like snails melting away as they move.
may they be like a baby born dead, who never saw the light of day.
may they be destroyed suddenly, like the thorns that are burned to quickly heat a pot.
good people will be happy when they see the wicked getting the punishment they deserve.
they will feel like soldiers walking through the blood of their enemies!
then people will say, “good people really are rewarded.
yes, there is a god judging the world!” 
exodus.
chapter 28.
“tell your brother aaron and his sons, nadab, abihu, eleazar, and ithamar, to come to you from the israelites.
these men will serve me as priests.
“make special clothes for your brother aaron.
these clothes will give him honor and respect.
i have given special wisdom to some of the skilled men.
tell them to make the clothes for aaron.
these clothes will show that he serves me in a special way.
then he can serve me as a priest.
these are the clothes the men should make: the judgment pouch, the ephod, a blue robe, a white woven robe, a turban, and a cloth belt.
they must make these special clothes for your brother aaron and his sons.
then aaron and his sons can serve me as priests.
tell the men to use gold thread, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn.
“use gold thread, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn to make the ephod.
this must be the work of a very skilled person.
at each shoulder of the ephod, there should be a shoulder piece.
these shoulder pieces should be tied to the two corners of the ephod.
“the men will very carefully weave a cloth belt for the ephod.
this belt must be made the same way as the ephod—use gold threads, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn.
“take two onyx stones.
write the names of the twelve sons of israel on these jewels.
write six names on one jewel and six names on the other jewel.
write the names in order, from the oldest son to the youngest.
cut the names of the sons of israel into these stones.
do this the way a worker makes a seal.
put the jewels in gold settings.
then put these two jewels on the shoulder pieces of the ephod.
aaron will wear this special coat when he stands before the lord.
and the two stones with the names of the sons of israel will be on the ephod.
these jewels will cause the lord to remember the israelites.
use fine gold to hold the stones on the ephod.
twist chains of pure gold together like a rope.
make two of these gold chains and fasten them to the gold settings.
“make the judgment pouch for the high priest.
skilled workers should make this pouch just as they made the ephod.
they must use gold threads, fine linen, and blue, purple, and red yarn.
the judgment pouch should be folded double to make a square pocket.
it should be 1 span long and 1 span wide.
put four rows of beautiful jewels on the judgment pouch.
the first row of jewels should have a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl.
the second row should have a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald.
the third row should have a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.
the fourth row should have a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper.
set all these jewels in gold.
there will be twelve jewels on the judgment pouch—one stone for each of the sons of israel.
each stone will be like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes cut into it.
“make chains of pure gold for the judgment pouch.
these chains must be braided like a rope.
make two gold rings and put them on two corners of the judgment pouch.
put the two golden chains through the two rings at the corners of the judgment pouch.
fasten the other ends of the gold chains to the two settings.
this will fasten them to the two shoulder pieces of the ephod on the front.
make two more gold rings and put them on the other two corners of the judgment pouch.
this will be on the inside edge of the judgment pouch next to the ephod.
make two more gold rings and put them on the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod.
put the gold rings above the cloth belt of the ephod.
use blue ribbon to tie the rings of the judgment pouch to the rings of the ephod.
in this way the judgment pouch will rest close to the cloth belt and will be held against the ephod.
“when aaron enters the holy place, he must wear the judgment pouch.
in this way he will wear the names of the twelve sons of israel over his heart.
and the lord will always be reminded of them.
put the urim and thummim inside the judgment pouch.
they will be over aaron’s heart when he goes before the lord.
so aaron will always carry with him a way of judging for the israelites when he is before the lord.
“make a blue robe for the ephod.
make a hole in the center for the head.
and sew a piece of cloth around the edge of this hole.
this cloth will be like a collar that keeps the hole from tearing.
use blue, purple, and red yarn to make cloth pomegranates.
hang these pomegranates around the bottom edge of the robe, and hang gold bells between the pomegranates.
so around the bottom edge of the robe there should be bells and pomegranates.
there should be a bell following each pomegranate.
aaron will wear this robe when he serves as a priest.
the bells will ring as aaron goes into the holy place to stand before the lord, and the bells will ring as he leaves the holy place.
this way aaron will not die.
“make a strip of pure gold and carve these words into the gold like the writing on a seal: holy to the lord.
fasten the gold strip to a blue ribbon.
tie the blue ribbon around the turban.
the gold strip should be on the front of the turban.
aaron will wear this on his head.
in this way he will remove the guilt if anything is wrong with the gifts that the israelites give to god.
aaron will always wear this on his head so that the lord will accept the gifts of the people.
“use fine linen to make the white woven robe and the turban.
the cloth belt should have designs sewn into it.
also make coats, belts, and cloth caps for aaron’s sons.
this will give them honor and respect.
put the clothes on your brother aaron and his sons.
then pour the special oil on them to make them priests.
this will make them holy, and they will serve me as priests.
“use linen to make underclothes for the priests.
these underclothes will cover them from the waist to the thighs.
aaron and his sons must wear these clothes whenever they enter the meeting tent.
they must wear these clothes when they come near to the altar to serve as priests in the holy place.
if they don’t wear these clothes, they will be guilty of wrong and will have to die.
all this should be a law that continues forever for aaron and all his family after him.
chapter 9.
“listen, you israelites!
you will go across the jordan river today.
you will go into that land to force out nations greater and stronger than you.
their cities are big and have walls as high as the sky!
the people there are tall and strong.
they are the anakites.
you know about them.
you heard our spies say, ‘no one can win against the anakites.’ 
but you can be sure that it is the lord your god who goes across the river before you—and god is like a fire that destroys!
he will destroy those nations and make them fall before you.
you will force those nations out and quickly destroy them.
the lord has promised you that this will happen.
“the lord your god will force those nations out for you.
but don’t say to yourselves, ‘the lord brought us to live in this land because we are such good people.’ no, the lord forced those nations out because they were evil, not because you were good.
you are going in to take their land, but not because you are good and live right.
you are going in, and the lord your god is forcing those people out because of the evil way they lived.
and the lord wants to keep the promise he made to your ancestors, abraham, isaac, and jacob.
the lord your god is giving you that good land to live in, but you should know that it is not because you are good.
the truth is that you are very stubborn people!
“remember how you made the lord your god angry in the desert.
never forget that!
from the day you left the land of egypt to the day you came to this place, you have refused to obey the lord.
you made the lord angry at mount horeb.
the lord was angry enough to destroy you!
i went up the mountain to get the stone tablets.
the agreement that the lord made with you was written on those stones.
i stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights.
i did not eat any food or drink any water.
the lord gave me the two stone tablets.
he wrote his commands on the stones with his finger.
the lord wrote everything he said to you from the fire when you were gathered together at the mountain.
“so at the end of 40 days and 40 nights, the lord gave me two stone tablets—the stones of the agreement.
then the lord said to me, ‘get up and quickly go down from here.
the people you brought out of egypt have ruined themselves.
they stopped obeying my commands so quickly.
they melted gold and made an idol for themselves.’ 
“the lord also said to me, ‘i have watched these people.
they are very stubborn!
let me destroy these people completely, so no one will even remember their names.
then i will make another nation from you that is stronger and greater than these people.’ 
“then i turned and came down from the mountain.
the mountain was burning with fire.
and the two stone tablets of the agreement were in my hands.
i looked and i saw you had sinned against the lord your god.
i saw the calf you made from melted gold!
you stopped obeying the lord so quickly.
so i took the two stone tablets and threw them down.
there before your eyes i broke the stones into pieces.
then i bowed down before the lord with my face to the ground for 40 days and 40 nights, as i did before.
i did not eat any food or drink any water.
i did this because you had sinned so badly.
you did the thing that is evil to the lord, and you made him angry.
i was afraid of the lord’s terrible anger.
he was angry enough to destroy you, but the lord listened to me again.
the lord was very angry with aaron—enough to destroy him!
so i also prayed for aaron at that time.
i took that terrible thing, the calf you made, and burned it in the fire.
i broke it into small pieces.
and i crushed the pieces until they were dust.
then i threw the dust into the river that came down from the mountain.
“also, at taberah, massah, and kibroth hattaavah you made the lord angry.
and you did not obey when the lord told you to leave kadesh barnea.
he said, ‘go up and take the land i am giving you.’ but you refused to obey the lord your god.
you did not trust him.
you did not listen to his command.
all the time that i have known you, you have refused to obey the lord.
“so i bowed down before the lord 40 days and 40 nights, because the lord said he would destroy you.
i prayed to the lord.
i said, ‘lord god, don’t destroy your people.
they belong to you.
you freed them and brought them out of egypt with your great power and strength.
remember your promise to your servants abraham, isaac, and jacob.
forget how stubborn these people are.
don’t look at their evil ways or their sins.
if you punish your people, the egyptians might say, “the lord was not able to take his people into the land he promised them.
and he hated them.
so he took them into the desert to kill them.” 
but they are your people, lord.
they belong to you.
you brought them out of egypt with your great power and strength.’ 
genesis.
chapter 21.
the lord came back to visit sarah as he said he would, and he kept his promise to her.
at exactly the time god said it would happen, sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for abraham in his old age.
abraham named his son isaac.
abraham did what god commanded and circumcised isaac when he was eight days old.
abraham was 100 years old when his son isaac was born.
sarah said, “god has made me happy, and everyone who hears about this will be happy with me.
no one thought that i, sarah, would be able to have abraham’s child.
but i have given abraham a son, even though he is old.” 
isaac continued to grow, and soon he was old enough to begin eating solid food.
so abraham gave a big party.
sarah saw hagar’s son playing.
(hagar was the egyptian slave woman who gave birth to abraham’s first son.)
sarah said to abraham, “get rid of that slave woman and her son.
send them away!
when we die, our son isaac will get everything we have.
i don’t want that slave woman’s son sharing these things with my son isaac!” 
this upset abraham very much.
he was worried about his son ishmael.
but god said to abraham, “don’t worry about the boy and the slave woman.
do what sarah wants.
your descendants will be those who come through isaac.
but i will also bless the son of your slave woman.
he is your son, so i will make a great nation from his family also.” 
early the next morning abraham took some food and water and gave them to hagar.
she carried them and left with her boy.
she left that place and wandered in the desert of beersheba.
after some time, when all their drinking water was gone, hagar put her son under a bush.
then she walked a short distance away and sat down.
she thought her son would die because there was no water.
she did not want to watch him die.
she sat there and began to cry.
god heard the boy crying, and god’s angel called to hagar from heaven.
he said, “what is wrong, hagar?
don’t be afraid!
god has heard the boy crying there.
go help the boy.
hold his hand and lead him.
i will make him the father of many people.” 
then god allowed hagar to see a well of water.
so she went to the well and filled her bag with water.
then she gave water to the boy to drink.
god continued to be with the boy while he grew up.
ishmael lived in the desert and became a hunter.
he learned to shoot a bow very well.
his mother found a wife for him in egypt.
they continued to live in the paran desert.
then abimelech and phicol spoke with abraham.
phicol was the commander of abimelech’s army.
they said to abraham, “god is with you in everything you do.
so make a promise to me here before god.
promise that you will be fair with me and with my children.
promise that you will be kind to me and this country where you have lived.
promise that you will be as kind to me as i have been to you.” 
and abraham said, “i promise to treat you the same way you have treated me.” 
then abraham complained to abimelech because abimelech’s servants had captured a well of water.
but abimelech said, “i don’t know who did this.
you never told me about this before today!” 
so abraham and abimelech made an agreement.
abraham gave abimelech some sheep and cattle as proof of the agreement.
abraham also put seven female lambs in front of abimelech.
abimelech asked abraham, “why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves?” 
abraham answered, “when you accept these lambs from me, it will be proof that i dug this well.” 
so after that, the well was called beersheba.
abraham gave the well this name because it was the place where they made a promise to each other.
so abraham and abimelech made an agreement at beersheba.
then abimelech and phicol, his military commander, went back to the country of the philistines.
abraham planted a special tree at beersheba and prayed to the lord, the god who lives forever.
and abraham lived as a stranger for a long time in the country of the philistines.
chapter 24.
abraham lived to be a very old man.
the lord blessed him and everything he did.
abraham’s oldest servant was in charge of everything he owned.
abraham called that servant to him and said, “put your hand under my leg.
now i want you to make a promise to me.
promise to me before the lord, the god of heaven and earth, that you will not allow my son to marry a girl from canaan.
we live among these people, but don’t let him marry a canaanite girl.
go back to my country, to my own people, to find a wife for my son isaac.
bring her here to him.” 
the servant said to him, “maybe this woman will not want to come back with me to this land.
if that happens, should i take your son with me to your homeland?” 
abraham said to him, “no, don’t take my son to that place.
the lord, the god of heaven, brought me from my homeland to this place.
that place was the home of my father and the home of my family, but he promised that this new land would belong to my family.
may he send his angel before you so that you can choose a wife for my son.
if the girl refuses to come with you, you will be free from this promise.
but you must not take my son back to that place.” 
so the servant put his hand under his master’s leg and made the promise.
the servant took ten of abraham’s camels and left that place.
the servant carried with him many different kinds of beautiful gifts.
he went to mesopotamia, to nahor’s city.
in the evening, when the women come out to get water, he went to the water well outside the city.
he made the camels kneel down at the well.
the servant said, “lord, you are the god of my master abraham.
please show your kindness to my master by helping me find a wife for his son isaac.
here i am, standing by this well of water, and the young women from the city are coming out to get water.
i will say to one of them, ‘please put your jar down so that i can drink.’ let her answer show whether she is the one you have chosen for your servant isaac.
if she says, ‘drink, and i will also give water to your camels,’ i will know that she is the right one.
it will be proof that you have shown kindness to my master.” 
before the servant finished praying, a young woman named rebekah came to the well.
she was the daughter of bethuel.
(bethuel was the son of milcah and nahor, abraham’s brother.)
rebekah came to the well with her water jar on her shoulder.
she was very pretty.
she was a virgin; no man had ever had sexual relations with her.
she went down to the well and filled her jar.
then the servant ran to her and said, “please give me a little water to drink from your jar.” 
rebekah quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and gave him a drink.
she said, “drink this, sir.” 
as soon as she finished giving him something to drink, rebekah said, “i will also pour some water for your camels.” 
so rebekah quickly poured all the water from her jar into the drinking trough for the camels.
then she ran to the well to get more water, and she gave water to all the camels.
the servant quietly watched her.
he wanted to be sure that the lord had given him an answer and had made his trip successful.
after the camels finished drinking, he gave rebekah a gold ring that weighed 1/4 ounce.
he also gave her two gold arm bracelets that weighed 2 ounces each.
the servant asked, “who is your father?
and is there a place in your father’s house for me and my men to sleep?” 
rebekah answered, “my father is bethuel, the son of milcah and nahor.” 
then she said, “yes, we have straw and other food for your camels and a place for you to sleep.” 
the servant bowed and worshiped the lord.
he said, “praise be to the lord, the god of my master abraham.
the lord has been kind and loyal to him by leading me to his own people.” 
then rebekah ran and told her family about all these things.
she had a brother named laban.
she told him what the man had said to her.
laban was listening to her.
and when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, he ran out to the well.
there the man was, standing by the camels at the well.
laban said, “sir, you are welcome to come in!
you don’t have to stand outside here.
i have prepared a room for you to sleep in and a place for your camels.” 
so abraham’s servant went into the house.
laban unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed.
then he gave abraham’s servant water so that he and the men with him could wash their feet.
laban then gave him food to eat, but the servant refused to eat.
he said, “i will not eat until i have told you why i came.” so laban said, “then tell us.” 
the servant said, “i am abraham’s servant.
the lord has greatly blessed my master in everything.
my master has become a great man.
the lord has given him many flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.
he has much silver and gold and many servants.
he has many camels and donkeys.
sarah was my master’s wife.
when she was very old, she gave birth to a son, and my master has given everything he owns to that son.
my master forced me to make a promise to him.
he said to me, ‘you must not allow my son to marry a girl from canaan.
we live among these people, but i don’t want him to marry one of the canaanite girls.
so you must promise to go to my father’s country.
go to my family and choose a wife for my son.’ 
i said to my master, ‘maybe the woman will not come back to this place with me.’ 
but my master said to me, ‘i serve the lord, and he will send his angel with you and help you.
you will find a wife for my son among my people there.
but if you go to my father’s country, and they refuse to give you a wife for my son, you will be free from this promise.’ 
“today i came to this well and said, ‘lord, god of my master abraham, please make my trip successful.
i will stand by this well and wait for a young woman to come to get water.
then i will say, “please give me water from your jar to drink.” 
the right woman will answer in a special way.
she will say, “drink this water, and i will also get water for your camels.” that way i will know that she is the one the lord has chosen for my master’s son.’ 
“before i finished praying, rebekah came out to the well to get water.
she had her water jar on her shoulder as she went to get water from the well.
i asked her to give me some water.
she quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and poured me some water.
then she said, ‘drink this, and i’ll get some water for your camels.’ so i drank the water, and she gave water to my camels.
then i asked her, ‘who is your father?’ she answered, ‘my father is bethuel the son of milcah and nahor.’ then i gave her the ring and bracelets for her arms.
i bowed my head and worshiped the lord.
i praised the lord, the god of my master abraham.
i thanked him for leading me straight to the granddaughter of my master’s brother.
now, tell me, will you be kind and loyal to my master and give him your daughter?
or will you refuse to give her to him?
tell me so that i will know what i should do.” 
then laban and bethuel answered, “we see that this is from the lord, so there is nothing we can say to change it.
here is rebekah.
take her and go.
let her marry your master’s son.
this is what the lord wants.” 
when abraham’s servant heard this, he bowed to the ground before the lord.
then he gave rebekah the gifts he brought.
he gave her beautiful clothes and gold and silver jewelry.
he also gave expensive gifts to her mother and brother.
then he and his men had something to eat and drink, and they spent the night there.
early the next morning they got up and the servant said, “now we must go back to my master.” 
rebekah’s mother and her brother said, “let rebekah stay with us for a short time.
let her stay with us ten days.
after that she can go.” 
but the servant said to them, “don’t make me wait.
the lord has made my trip successful.
now let me go back to my master.” 
rebekah’s brother and mother said, “we will call rebekah and ask her what she wants to do.” 
they called her and asked her, “do you want to go with this man now?” rebekah said, “yes, i will go.” 
so they allowed rebekah to go with abraham’s servant and his men.
her nurse also went with them.
while rebekah was leaving they said to her, “our sister, may you be the mother of millions of people, and may your descendants defeat their enemies and take their cities.” 
then rebekah and her nurse got on the camels and followed the servant and his men.
so the servant took rebekah and left.
isaac had left beer lahai roi and was now living in the negev.
one evening he went out to the field to think.
he looked up and saw the camels coming from far away.
rebekah also looked and saw isaac.
then she jumped down from the camel.
she said to the servant, “who is that young man walking in the field to meet us?” the servant said, “that is my master’s son.” so rebekah covered her face with her veil.
the servant told isaac everything that had happened.
then isaac brought the girl into his mother’s tent.
rebekah became his wife that day.
isaac loved her very much.
so he was comforted after his mother’s death.
2 kings.
chapter 10.
ahab had 70 sons in samaria.
jehu wrote letters and sent them to samaria to the rulers and leaders of jezreel.
he also sent the letters to the people who raised ahab’s sons saying, 
“as soon as you get this letter, choose the one who is the best and most worthy among your master’s sons.
you have chariots and horses.
and you are living in a strong city.
you also have weapons.
put the son you choose on his father’s throne.
then fight for your master’s family.” 
but the rulers and leaders of jezreel were very afraid.
they said, “the two kings could not stop jehu.
so we cannot stop him either!” 
the palace manager, the official in charge of the city, the elders, and the people who raised the king’s children sent a message to jehu.
“we are your servants and we will do whatever you tell us.
we will not make anyone king; you may do whatever you think is best.” 
then jehu wrote a second letter to these leaders.
he said, “if you support me and obey me, cut off the heads of ahab’s sons.
bring them to me at jezreel about this time tomorrow.” ahab had 70 sons.
they were with the leaders of the city who raised them.
when the leaders of the city received the letter, they took the king’s sons and killed all 70 of them.
then the leaders put the heads of the king’s sons in baskets and sent the baskets to jehu at jezreel.
the messenger came to jehu and told him, “they have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” then jehu said, “lay the heads in two piles at the city gate until morning.” 
in the morning jehu went out and stood before the people.
he said to them, “you are innocent.
look, i made plans against my master.
i killed him.
but who killed all these sons of ahab?
you killed them.
you should know that everything the lord says will happen.
the lord used elijah to say these things about ahab’s family.
now the lord has done what he said he would do.” 
so jehu killed all the people in ahab’s family living in jezreel.
he killed all the important men, close friends, and priests.
none of ahab’s people were left alive.
jehu left jezreel and went to samaria.
on the way, he stopped at a place called shepherd’s camp.
there he met with the relatives of king ahaziah of judah.
jehu asked, “who are you?” they answered, “we are the relatives of king ahaziah of judah.
we have come down to visit the king’s children and the queen mother’s children.” 
then jehu said, “take them alive!” jehu’s men captured ahaziah’s relatives alive.
there were 42 of them.
jehu killed them at the well near beth eked.
he did not leave anyone alive.
after jehu left there, he met jehonadab son of recab.
jehonadab was on his way to meet jehu.
jehu greeted jehonadab and said to him, “are you a faithful friend to me, as i am to you?” jehonadab answered, “yes, i am a faithful friend to you.” jehu said, “if you are, give me your hand.” then jehu reached out and pulled jehonadab up into the chariot.
jehu said, “come with me.
you can see how strong my feelings are for the lord.” so jehonadab rode in jehu’s chariot.
jehu came to samaria and killed all ahab’s family who were still alive in samaria.
he killed them all.
he did what the lord had told elijah.
then jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, “ahab served baal a little, but jehu will serve baal much.
now call together all the priests and prophets of baal.
and call together everyone who worships baal.
don’t let anyone miss this meeting.
i have a great sacrifice to give to baal.
i will kill anyone who does not come to this meeting.” but jehu was tricking them.
he wanted to destroy the worshipers of baal.
jehu said, “prepare a holy meeting for baal.” so the priests announced the meeting.
then jehu sent a message through all the land of israel.
all the worshipers of baal came.
not one stayed home.
the baal worshipers came into the temple of baal.
the temple was filled with people.
jehu said to the man who kept the robes, “bring out the robes for all the worshipers of baal.” so that man brought out the robes for the baal worshipers.
then jehu and jehonadab son of recab went into the temple of baal.
jehu said to the worshipers of baal, “look around and be sure that there are no servants of the lord with you.
be sure there are only people who worship baal.” 
the worshipers of baal went into the temple of baal to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
but outside, jehu had 80 men waiting.
he told them, “don’t let anyone escape.
if any man lets one person escape, that man must pay with his own life.” 
quickly after jehu had finished offering the burnt offering, he said to the guards and to the captains, “go in and kill the worshipers of baal!
don’t let anyone come out of the temple alive!” so the captains used thin swords and killed the worshipers of baal.
they threw the bodies of the worshipers of baal out.
then the guards and the captains went to the inner room of the temple of baal.
they brought out the memorial stones that were in the temple of baal and burned that temple.
then they smashed the memorial stones of baal.
they also smashed the temple of baal.
they made the temple of baal into a public toilet, which is still used today.
so jehu destroyed baal worship in israel, 
but he did not completely turn away from the sins of jeroboam son of nebat that caused israel to sin.
jehu did not destroy the golden calves in bethel and in dan.
the lord said to jehu, “you have done well.
you have done what i say is good.
you destroyed ahab’s family the way i wanted you to, so your descendants will rule israel for four generations.” 
but jehu was not careful to follow the law of the lord with all his heart.
jehu did not stop committing the sins of jeroboam that caused israel to sin.
at that time the lord began to cut away sections of israel and give them to other nations.
king hazael of aram defeated the israelites on every border of israel.
he won the land east of the jordan river—all the land of gilead, including the land that belonged to the tribes of gad, reuben, and manasseh.
he won all the land from aroer by the arnon valley to gilead and bashan.
all the other great things that jehu did are written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
jehu died and was buried with his ancestors.
the people buried him in samaria.
his son jehoahaz became the new king of israel after him.
jehu ruled over israel in samaria for 28 years.
chapter 1.
this is the message of amos, one of the shepherds from the city tekoa.
he saw visions about israel during the time that uzziah was king of judah and jeroboam son of joash was king of israel.
this was two years before the earthquake.
amos said, “the lord will shout like a lion in zion.
his loud voice will roar from jerusalem.
the green pastures of the shepherds will turn brown and die.
even mount carmel will become dry.” 
this is what the lord says: “i will definitely punish the people of damascus for the many crimes they did.
they crushed the people of gilead with iron threshing tools.
so i will start a fire at hazael’s house that will destroy the great palaces of ben-hadad.
“i will also break open the gates of damascus and remove the one who sits on the throne in the valley of aven.
i will remove the symbol of power from beth eden, and the arameans will be defeated and taken back to kir.” this is what the lord said.
this is what the lord says: “i will definitely punish the people of gaza for the many crimes they did.
they took an entire nation of people and sent them as slaves to edom.
so i will start a fire at the wall of gaza that will destroy the high towers in gaza.
and i will destroy the one who sits on the throne in ashdod.
i will destroy the king who holds the scepter in ashkelon.
i will punish the people of ekron.
then the philistines who are still left alive will die.” this is what the lord god said.
this is what the lord says: “i will definitely punish the people of tyre for the many crimes they did.
they took an entire nation and sent them as slaves to edom.
they did not remember the agreement they had made with their brothers.
so i will start a fire at the walls of tyre that will destroy the high towers in tyre.” 
this is what the lord says: “i will definitely punish the people of edom for their many crimes.
edom chased his brother with the sword, and he showed no mercy.
his anger never stopped.
he kept tearing and tearing at israel like a wild animal.
so i will start a fire at teman that will destroy the high towers of bozrah.” 
this is what the lord says: “i will definitely punish the ammonites for the many crimes they did.
they killed the pregnant women in gilead.
the ammonites did this so that they could take that land and make their country larger.
so i will start a fire at the wall of rabbah that will destroy the high towers of rabbah.
troubles will come to them like a whirlwind into their country.
then their kings and leaders will be captured.
they will all be taken together.” this is what the lord said.
chapter 4.
the lord said to moses and aaron, 
“count the men in the families of the kohath family group.
(the kohath family group is a part of levi’s family group.)
count all the men from 30 to 50 years old who come to serve.
these men will work in the meeting tent.
their job is to take care of the most holy things in the meeting tent.
“when the israelites travel to a new place, aaron and his sons must go into the meeting tent and take down the curtain and cover the box of the agreement with it.
then they must cover all of this with covering made from fine leather.
then they must spread the solid blue cloth over the leather and put the poles in the rings on the holy box.
“then they must spread a blue cloth over the holy table.
then they must put the plates, spoons, bowls, and the jars for drink offerings on the table.
put the special bread on the table.
then you must put a red cloth over all these things, cover everything with fine leather, and put the poles in the rings of the table.
“then they must cover the lampstand and its lamps with a blue cloth.
they must also cover all the things used to keep the lamps burning and all the jars of oil that are used in the lamps.
then wrap everything in fine leather.
then they must put all these things on poles used for carrying them.
“they must spread a blue cloth over the golden altar.
they must cover that with fine leather.
then they must put the poles for carrying it in the rings on the altar.
“then they must gather together all the special things that are used for worship in the holy place.
they must gather them together and wrap them in a blue cloth.
then they must cover that with fine leather.
they must put these things on a frame for carrying them.
“they must clean the ashes out of the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
then they must gather together all the things that are used for worship at the altar.
these are the firepans, forks, shovels, and the bowls.
they must put these things on the bronze altar.
then they must spread a covering of fine leather over the altar and put the poles for carrying it in the rings on the altar.
“aaron and his sons must finish covering all the holy things in the holy place.
then the men from the kohath family can go in and begin carrying these things.
in this way they will not touch the holy things and die.
“eleazar son of aaron the priest will be responsible for the holy tent.
he will be responsible for everything in it, including the holy things.
he will be responsible for the oil for the lamp, the sweet-smelling incense, the daily offering, and the anointing oil.” 
the lord said to moses and aaron, 
“be careful!
don’t let these kohathite men be destroyed.
you must do these things so that the kohathite men can go near the most holy things and not die.
aaron and his sons must go in and show each kohathite man what to do and what to carry.
if you don’t do this, the kohathite men might go in and look at the holy things.
if they look at these things, even for a moment, they must die.” 
the lord said to moses, 
“count all the people of the gershon family.
list them by family and family group.
count all the men who are from 30 to 50 years old who come to serve.
these men will have the job of caring for the meeting tent.
“this is what the gershonite family must do and the things they must carry: 
they must carry the curtains of the holy tent, the meeting tent, its covering, and the covering made from fine leather.
they must also carry the curtain at the entrance of the meeting tent.
they must carry the curtains of the courtyard that are around the holy tent and the altar.
and they must carry the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard.
they must also carry all the ropes and all the things that are used with the curtains.
the gershonite men will be responsible for anything that needs to be done with these things.
aaron and his sons will watch all the work that is done.
everything the gershonites carry and the other work they do will be watched by aaron and his sons.
you must tell them what they are responsible for carrying.
this is the work that the men of the gershonite family group must do for the meeting tent.
ithamar son of aaron the priest will be responsible for their work.” 
“count all the men in the families and family groups in the merari family group.
count all the men who are from 30 to 50 years old and come to serve.
these men will do a special work for the meeting tent.
when you travel, it is their job to carry the frames of the meeting tent.
they must carry the braces, the posts, and the bases.
they must also carry the posts that are around the courtyard.
they must carry the bases, the tent pegs, the ropes, and everything that is used for the poles around the courtyard.
list the names and tell each man exactly what he must carry.
this is what the people from the merari family will do to serve in the work for the meeting tent.
ithamar son of aaron the priest will be responsible for their work.” 
moses, aaron, and the leaders of the israelites counted the kohathites.
they counted them by families and family groups.
they counted all the men from 30 to 50 years old who were able to serve.
these men were given special work to do for the meeting tent.
there were 2750 men in the kohath family group who were qualified to do this work.
so these men from the kohath family group were given their special work to do for the meeting tent.
moses and aaron did this the way the lord had told moses to do.
also, the gershonite family group was counted.
all the men from 30 to 50 years old who qualified to serve were counted.
these men were given their special work to do for the meeting tent.
there were 2630 men in the families of the gershon family group who were qualified.
so these men from the gershon family group were given their special work to do for the meeting tent.
moses and aaron did this the way the lord had told moses to do.
also, the men in the families and family groups of the merari family were counted.
all the men from 30 to 50 years old who qualified to serve were counted.
these men were given their special work to do for the meeting tent.
there were 3200 men in the families of the merari family group who were qualified.
so these men from the merari family group were given their special work.
moses and aaron did this the way the lord told moses to do.
so moses, aaron, and the leaders of the israelites counted all the people in levi’s family group.
they had counted each family and each family group.
all the men between the ages of 30 and 50 who qualified to serve were counted.
these men were given a special work to do for the meeting tent.
they did the work of carrying the meeting tent when they traveled.
the total number was 8580. 
each man was counted just as the lord commanded moses.
each man was given his own work and told what he must carry just as the lord had said.
chapter 13.
again the people started doing what the lord said was wrong.
so the lord allowed the philistines to rule over them for 40 years.
there was a man named manoah from the city of zorah.
he was from the tribe of dan.
manoah had a wife, but she was not able to have any children.
the angel of the lord appeared to manoah’s wife and said, “you have not been able to have children.
but you will become pregnant and have a son.
don’t drink any wine or any other strong drink.
don’t eat any food that is unclean, 
because you are pregnant, and you will have a son.
he will be dedicated to god in a special way.
he will be a nazirite.
so you must never cut his hair.
he will be god’s special person from before he is born.
he will save the israelites from the power of the philistines.” 
then the woman went to her husband and told him what had happened.
she said, “a man of god came to me.
he looked like the angel of god.
he frightened me.
i didn’t ask him where he was from, and he didn’t tell me his name.
but he said to me, ‘you are pregnant and will have a son.
don’t drink any wine or other strong drink.
don’t eat any food that is unclean, because the boy will be dedicated to god in a special way.
the boy will be god’s special person from before he is born until the day he dies.’” 
then manoah prayed to the lord.
he said, “lord, i beg you to send the man of god to us again.
we want him to teach us what we should do for the boy who will soon be born.” 
god heard manoah’s prayer.
the angel of god came to the woman again.
she was sitting in a field and her husband manoah was not with her.
so the woman ran to tell her husband, “the man is back!
the man who came to me the other day is here.” 
manoah got up and followed his wife.
when he came to the man, he said, “are you the same man who spoke to my wife before?” the angel said, “i am.” 
so manoah said, “may what you say happen.
tell me, what kind of life will the boy live?
what will he do?” 
the angel of the lord said to manoah, “your wife must do everything i told her.
she must not eat anything that grows on a grapevine.
she must not drink any wine or strong drink.
she must not eat any food that is unclean.
she must do everything that i have commanded her to do.” 
then manoah said to the angel of the lord, “we would like for you to stay a while.
we want to cook a young goat for you to eat.” 
the angel of the lord said to manoah, “even if you keep me from leaving, i will not eat your food.
but if you want to prepare something, offer a burnt offering to the lord.” (manoah did not understand that the man was really the angel of the lord.)
then manoah asked the angel of the lord, “what is your name?
we want to know so that we can honor you when what you have said really happens.” 
the angel of the lord said, “why do you ask my name?
it is too amazing for you to believe.” 
then manoah sacrificed a young goat on a rock.
he offered the goat and a grain offering as a gift to the lord and to the one who does amazing things.
manoah and his wife were watching what happened.
as the flames went up to the sky from the altar, the angel of the lord went up to heaven in the fire.
when manoah and his wife saw that, they bowed down with their faces to the ground.
he finally understood that the man was really the angel of the lord.
the angel of the lord did not appear to manoah and his wife again.
manoah said to his wife, “we have seen god.
surely we will die because of this.” 
but his wife said to him, “the lord does not want to kill us.
if he wanted to kill us, he would not have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering.
he would not have shown us all these things or told us this.” 
so the woman had a boy.
she named him samson.
he grew and the lord blessed him.
the spirit of the lord began to work in samson while he was in the city of mahaneh dan.
that city is between the cities of zorah and eshtaol.
chapter 12.
miriam and aaron began to talk against moses.
they criticized him because he married an ethiopian woman.
they said to themselves, “moses is not the only one the lord has used to speak to the people.
he has also spoken through us!” the lord heard this.
(moses was a very humble man.
he was more humble than any other man on earth.)
so suddenly, the lord came and spoke to moses, aaron, and miriam.
he said, “you three, come to the meeting tent, now!” so moses, aaron, and miriam went to the tent.
the lord came down in the tall cloud and stood at the entrance to the tent.
he called out, “aaron and miriam!” they went to him.
god said, “listen to me!
you will have prophets.
i, the lord, will let them learn about me through visions.
i will speak to them in dreams.
but moses is not like that.
he is my faithful servant—i trust him with everyone in my house.
when i speak to him, i talk face to face with him.
i don’t use stories with hidden meanings—i show him clearly what i want him to know.
and moses can look at the very image of the lord.
so why were you brave enough to speak against my servant moses?” 
the lord was very angry with them, and he left them.
the cloud rose from the tent.
aaron turned and looked at miriam.
her skin was white like snow—she had a terrible skin disease!
then aaron said to moses, “please, sir, forgive us for the foolish sin that we did.
don’t let her lose her skin like a baby who is born dead.” (sometimes a baby will be born like that, with half of its skin eaten away.)
so moses prayed to the lord, “god, please heal her from this sickness!” 
the lord answered moses, “if her father spit in her face, she would be shamed for seven days.
so put her outside the camp for seven days.
after that she can come back into the camp.” 
so they took miriam outside the camp for seven days.
and the people did not move from that place until she was brought in again.
after that the people left hazeroth and traveled to the desert of paran where they set up camp.
chapter 47.
to the director: a song from the korah family.
everyone, clap your hands.
shout with joy to god!
the lord most high is awesome.
he is the great king over all the earth.
he helped us defeat other nations.
he put those people under our control.
he chose our land for us.
he chose that wonderful land for jacob, the one he loved.
selah 
the lord god goes up to his throne at the sound of the trumpet and horn.
sing praises to god, sing praises!
sing praises to our king, sing praises!
god is the king of the whole world.
sing songs of praise!
god sits on his holy throne; he rules all the nations.
the leaders of the nations have come together with the people of the god of abraham.
all the rulers of the world belong to god.
he is over them all!
chapter 11.
there was a time when the whole world spoke one language.
everyone used the same words.
then people began to move from the east.
they found a plain in the land of babylonia and stayed there to live.
then they said to each other, “let’s make some bricks of clay and bake them in the fire.” then they used these bricks as stones, and they used tar as mortar.
then the people said, “let’s build ourselves a city and a tower that will reach to the sky.
then we will be famous.
this will keep us together so that we will not be scattered all over the earth.” 
then the lord came down to see the city and the tower.
the lord said, “these people all speak the same language.
and i see that they are joined together to do this work.
this is only the beginning of what they can do.
soon they will be able to do anything they want.
let’s go down and confuse their language.
then they will not understand each other.” 
so people stopped building the city, and the lord scattered them all over the earth.
that is the place where the lord confused the language of the whole world.
that is why it is called babel.
and it was from there that the lord caused the people to spread out to all the other places on earth.
this is the history of shem’s family.
two years after the flood, when shem was 100 years old, his son arphaxad was born.
after that shem lived 500 years.
he had other sons and daughters.
when arphaxad was 35 years old, his son shelah was born.
after shelah was born, arphaxad lived 403 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after shelah was 30 years old, his son eber was born.
after eber was born, shelah lived 403 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after eber was 34 years old, his son peleg was born.
after peleg was born, eber lived another 430 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after peleg was 30 years old, his son reu was born.
after reu was born, peleg lived another 209 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after reu was 32 years old, his son serug was born.
after serug was born, reu lived another 207 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after serug was 30 years old, his son nahor was born.
after nahor was born, serug lived another 200 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after nahor was 29 years old, his son terah was born.
after terah was born, nahor lived another 119 years.
during that time he had other sons and daughters.
after terah was 70 years old, his sons abram, nahor, and haran were born.
this is the history of terah’s family.
terah was the father of abram, nahor, and haran.
haran was the father of lot.
haran died in his hometown, ur of babylonia, while his father terah was still alive.
abram and nahor both married.
abram’s wife was named sarai.
nahor’s wife was named milcah.
milcah was the daughter of haran.
haran was the father of milcah and iscah.
sarai did not have any children because she was not able to have children.
terah took his family and left ur of babylonia.
they planned to travel to canaan.
terah took his son abram, his grandson lot (haran’s son), and his daughter-in-law sarai (abram’s wife).
they traveled to the city of haran and decided to stay there.
terah lived to be 205 years old.
he died in haran.
chapter 31.
then the lord said to moses, 
“i have chosen a man from the tribe of judah to do some special work for me.
his name is bezalel son of uri son of hur.
i have filled bezalel with the spirit of god—i have given him the skill and knowledge to do all kinds of things.
he is a very good designer.
and he can make things from gold, silver, and bronze.
he can cut and set beautiful jewels.
and he can work with wood.
he can do all kinds of work.
i have also chosen oholiab to work with him.
oholiab is the son of ahisamach from the tribe of dan.
and i have given skills to all the other workers so that they can make everything that i have commanded you: 
the meeting tent; the box of the agreement; the mercy-cover that is on it; 
the table and everything on it; the pure gold lampstand and everything used with it; the altar for burning incense; 
the altar for burning offerings and the things used at the altar; the bowl and the base under it; 
the special clothes for aaron the priest; the special clothes for aaron’s sons when they serve as priests; 
the sweet-smelling anointing oil; the sweet-smelling incense for the holy place.
these workers must make everything the way that i have commanded you.” 
then the lord said to moses, 
“tell the israelites this: ‘you must follow the rules about my special days of rest.
you must do this because they will be a sign between you and me for all generations.
this will show you that i, the lord, have made you my special people.
“‘make the sabbath a special day.
if someone treats the sabbath like any other day, that person must be killed.
whoever works on the sabbath day must be separated from their people.
there are six other days in the week for working.
but the seventh day is a very special day of rest.
that is the special day to honor the lord.
anyone who works during the sabbath must be killed.
the israelites must remember the sabbath and make it a special day.
they must continue to do this forever.
it is an agreement between them and me that will continue forever.
the sabbath will be a sign between me and the israelites forever.’” (the lord worked six days and made the sky and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and relaxed.)
when god finished speaking to moses on mount sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets of the agreement.
god had written on the stones with his finger.
chapter 18.
some people like to do things their own way, and they get upset when people give them advice.
fools don’t want to learn from others.
they only want to tell their own ideas.
do something evil, and people will hate you.
do something shameful, and they will have no respect for you.
words from wise people are like water bubbling up from a deep well—the well of wisdom.
you must be fair in judging others.
it is wrong to favor the guilty and rob the innocent of justice.
fools say things to start arguments.
they are just asking for a beating.
fools hurt themselves when they speak.
their own words trap them.
people love to hear gossip.
it is like tasty food on its way to the stomach.
someone who does careless work is as bad as someone who destroys things.
the name of the lord is like a strong tower.
those who do what is right can run to him for protection.
the rich think their wealth will protect them.
they think it is a strong fortress.
a proud person will soon be ruined, but a humble person will be honored.
let people finish speaking before you try to answer them.
that way you will not embarrass yourself and look foolish.
a good attitude will support you when you are sick, but if you give up, nothing can help.
wise people want to learn more, so they listen closely to gain knowledge.
gifts can open many doors and help you meet important people.
the first person to speak always seems right until someone comes and asks the right questions.
the best way to settle an argument between two powerful people may be to use lots.
an insulted brother is harder to win back than a city with strong walls.
arguments separate people like the strong bars of a palace gate.
your words can be as satisfying as fruit, as pleasing as the food that fills your stomach.
the tongue can speak words that bring life or death.
those who love to talk must be ready to accept what it brings.
if you find a wife, you have found something good.
she shows that the lord is happy with you.
the poor are polite when they beg for help.
the rich are rude with their answer.
some friends are fun to be with, but a true friend can be better than a brother.
1 samuel.
chapter 23.
people told david, “look, the philistines are fighting against the city of keilah.
they are robbing grain from the threshing floors.” 
david asked the lord, “should i go and fight these philistines?” the lord answered david, “yes, go attack the philistines.
save keilah.” 
but david’s men said to him, “look, our men are afraid here in judah.
just think how afraid we will be if we go to keilah, where the philistine army is lined up and ready for battle.” 
david again asked the lord.
and the lord answered david, “go down to keilah.
i will help you defeat the philistines.” 
so david and his men went to keilah.
david’s men fought the philistines.
they defeated them and took their cattle.
in this way david saved the people of keilah.
(when abiathar ran away to david, abiathar took an ephod with him.)
people told saul that david was now at keilah.
saul said, “god has given david to me.
david trapped himself when he went into a city surrounded by a wall with gates and bars to lock them.” 
saul called all his army together for battle.
they prepared to go down to keilah to attack david and his men.
david learned that saul was making plans against him.
david then said to abiathar the priest, “bring the ephod.” 
david prayed, “lord, god of israel, i have heard that saul plans to come to keilah and destroy the town because of me.
will saul come to keilah?
will the people of keilah give me to saul?
lord, god of israel, i am your servant.
please tell me!” the lord answered, “saul will come.” 
again david asked, “will the people of keilah give me and my men to saul?” the lord answered, “they will.” 
so david and his men left keilah.
there were about 600 men who went with david.
they kept moving from place to place.
saul learned that david had escaped from keilah, so he did not go to that city.
david went into the desert of ziph and stayed in the mountains and fortresses there.
saul looked for david the whole time, but the lord didn’t let saul catch him.
david was at horesh in the desert of ziph.
he was afraid because saul was coming to kill him.
but saul’s son jonathan went to see david at horesh and encouraged him to have a stronger faith in god.
jonathan told david, “don’t be afraid.
my father saul won’t hurt you.
you will become the king of israel, and i will be second to you.
even my father knows this.” 
jonathan and david both made an agreement before the lord.
then jonathan went home, and david stayed at horesh.
some people from ziph went to saul at gibeah and told him, “david is hiding in our area.
he is at the fortresses of horesh on hakilah hill, south of jeshimon.
now, king, come down any time you want.
it is our duty to give david to you.” 
saul answered, “may the lord bless you for helping me.
go and learn more about david.
keep track of where he goes and who goes to see him.
i am told that david is smart and that he is trying to trick me.
find all the hiding places that david uses.
then come back to me and tell me everything.
then i’ll go with you.
if david is in the area, i will find him, even if i must go to every family group in judah.” 
so those people went back to ziph before saul.
david and his men were in the desert of maon, south of jeshimon.
saul and his men went to look for david, but the people warned him.
they told david that saul was looking for him.
so david then went down to “the rock” in the desert of maon.
saul heard that david had gone there, so saul went to that place to find him.
saul was on one side of the mountain.
david and his men were on the other side of the same mountain.
david was moving as quickly as possible to get away from saul.
but saul and his soldiers were going around the mountain to cut them off and trap david and his men.
then a messenger arrived and told saul, “come quickly!
the philistines are attacking.” 
so saul stopped chasing david and went to fight the philistines.
that is why people call this place “slippery rock.” 
david left the desert of maon and went to the fortresses near en gedi.
chapter 52.
wake up!
wake up!
zion, clothe yourself with strength.
holy city of jerusalem, stand up and put on your beautiful clothes!
those filthy foreigners will not enter you again.
jerusalem, get up and shake off the dust!
daughter zion, you were a prisoner, but take the chains off your neck.
the lord says, “you were not sold for money.
so i will not use money to set you free.” 
the lord god says, “first, my people went down to egypt and became slaves.
then assyria made them slaves.
now look what has happened.
another nation has taken my people,” says the lord.
“that country did not pay to take my people, but they rule over them and laugh at them, and they say bad things about me all the time.” the lord is the one saying these things.
“this happened so that my people will learn about me.
my people will know who i am.
my people will know my name, and they will know that i am he is speaking to them.” 
how wonderful it is to see someone coming over the hills to tell good news.
how wonderful to hear him announce, “there is peace!
we have been saved!” and to hear him say to zion, “your god is the king!” 
the city guards are shouting.
they are all rejoicing together.
they can all see the lord returning to zion.
ruins of jerusalem, be happy again!
rejoice because the lord comforted his people and set jerusalem free.
the lord showed his holy strength to all the nations.
all the faraway countries saw how god saved his people.
so leave babylon!
leave that place!
priests, you carry the things that belong to the lord.
so make yourselves pure.
don’t touch anything that is not pure.
you will leave babylon, but they will not force you to leave in a hurry.
you will not be forced to run away.
the lord will be in front of you.
the god of israel will be behind you.
the lord says, “look, my servant will succeed in what he has to do, and he will be raised to a position of high honor.
it is true that many were shocked when they saw him.
he was beaten so badly that he no longer looked like a man.
but it is also true that many nations will be amazed at him.
kings will look at him and be unable to speak.
they will see what they had never been told.
they will understand what they had never heard.” 
proverbs.
chapter 14.
a wise woman makes her home what it should be, but the home of a foolish woman is destroyed by her own actions.
those who live right respect the lord, but dishonest people hate him.
foolish words cause you trouble; wise words protect you.
a barn with no cattle might be clean, but strong bulls are needed for a good harvest.
a good witness is one who does not lie.
a bad witness is a liar who cannot be trusted.
anyone who makes fun of wisdom will never find it, but knowledge comes easily to those who understand its value.
stay away from fools, there is nothing they can teach you.
wisdom lets smart people know what they are doing, but stupid people only think they know.
fines are needed to make fools obey the law, but good people are happy to obey it.
when you are sad, no one else feels the pain; and when you are happy, no one else can really feel the joy.
an evil person’s house will be destroyed, but a good person’s family will do well.
there is a way that people think is right, but it leads only to death.
laughter might hide your sadness.
but when the laughter is gone, the sadness remains.
evil people will be paid back for the wrong they do, and good people will be rewarded for the good they do.
fools believe every word they hear, but wise people think carefully about everything.
wise people are careful and avoid trouble; fools are too confident and careless.
a quick-tempered person does stupid things, but it is also true that people don’t like anyone who quietly plans evil.
fools are rewarded with more foolishness.
smart people are rewarded with knowledge.
good people will defeat those who are evil, and the wicked will be forced to show respect to those who live right.
the poor have no friends, not even their neighbors, but the rich have many friends.
it is wrong to say bad things about your neighbors.
be kind to the poor, and you will be blessed.
whoever works to do good will find love and loyalty.
it is a mistake to work at doing evil.
if you work hard, you will have plenty.
if you do nothing but talk, you will not have enough.
a wise person’s reward is wealth, but a fool’s reward is foolishness.
a witness who tells the truth saves lives, but one who tells lies hurts others.
people who respect the lord will be safe, and they will make their children feel secure.
respect for the lord gives true life and will save you from death’s trap.
kings of large nations have great honor.
rulers without a country have nothing.
a patient person is very smart.
a quick-tempered person makes stupid mistakes.
peace of mind makes the body healthy, but jealousy is like a cancer.
whoever takes advantage of the poor insults their maker, but whoever is kind to them honors him.
the wicked will be defeated by their evil, but good people are protected by their honesty.
a wise person is always thinking wise thoughts, but a fool knows nothing about wisdom.
goodness makes a nation great, but sin is a shame to any people.
kings are pleased with intelligent officials, but they will punish shameful ones.
chapter 10.
just look at those lawmakers who write evil laws and make life hard for the people.
they are not fair to the poor.
they take away the rights of the poor and allow people to steal from widows and orphans.
lawmakers, you will have to explain what you have done.
what will you do then?
your destruction is coming from a faraway country.
where will you run for help?
your money and your riches will not help you.
you will have to bow down like a prisoner.
you will fall down like a dead man, but that will not help you.
god will still be angry and ready to punish you.
the lord says, “i will use assyria like a stick.
in my anger i will use assyria to punish israel.
i will send assyria to fight against the people who do evil.
i am angry with them, and i will command assyria to fight against them.
assyria will defeat them and take their wealth.
israel will be like dirt for assyria to walk on in the streets.
“but assyria does not understand that i will use him.
he does not think of himself as my tool.
he only wants to destroy other people.
he only plans to destroy many nations.
assyria says to himself, ‘all of my officers are like kings!
the city of calno is no better than the city of carchemish.
arpad is like hamath, and samaria is like damascus.
i defeated those evil kingdoms and now i control them.
the idols those people worship are better than the idols of jerusalem and samaria.
i defeated samaria and her gods.
i will also defeat jerusalem and the idols her people have made.’” 
when the lord finishes doing what he planned to jerusalem and mount zion, he will punish assyria.
the king of assyria is very proud.
his pride made him do many bad things, so god will punish him.
the king of assyria said, “i am very wise.
by my own wisdom and power i have done many great things.
i have defeated many nations.
i have taken their wealth and their people as slaves.
i am a very powerful man.
with my own hands i have taken the riches of all these people—like someone taking eggs from a bird’s nest.
a bird often leaves its nest and eggs, and there is nothing to protect the nest.
there is no bird to chirp and fight with its wings and beak, so anyone can come take the eggs.
and there is no one to stop me from taking all the people on earth.” 
an ax is not better than the one who cuts with it.
a saw is not better than the one who uses it.
is a stick stronger than the one who picks it up?
it can’t do anything to the person who is using it to punish someone!
but assyria doesn’t understand this.
so the lord god all-powerful will send a terrible disease against him.
he will lose his wealth and power like a sick man losing weight.
then assyria’s glory will be destroyed.
it will be like a fire burning until everything is gone.
the light of israel will be like a fire.
the holy one will be like a flame.
he will be like a fire that first begins to burn the weeds and thorns 
and then spreads to burn up the tall trees and vineyards.
finally, everything will be destroyed—even the people.
assyria will be like a rotting log.
there will be a few trees left standing in the forest—so few that even a child could count them.
then the people from jacob’s family who are left living in israel will stop depending on the one who beat them.
they will learn to depend on the lord, the holy one of israel.
those who are left in jacob’s family will again follow the powerful god.
israel, your people are as many as the sands of the sea, but only a few of them will be left to come back to god.
but before that happens, your country will be destroyed.
god has announced that he will destroy the land.
and then justice will come into the land like a river flowing full.
the lord god all-powerful really will destroy this land.
the lord god all-powerful says, “my people living in zion, don’t be afraid of assyria!
yes, he will beat you, and it will be just as the time when egypt beat you with a stick.
but after a short time my anger will stop.
i will be satisfied that assyria has punished you enough.” 
then the lord all-powerful will beat assyria with a whip, just as he defeated midian at raven rock.
he will punish his enemies, as he did when he raised his stick over the sea and led his people from egypt.
he will take away the troubles assyria brought you—troubles that are like heavy weights carried with a yoke on your neck.
but that yoke will be taken off your neck.
the burden will be lifted from your shoulders.
the army of assyria will enter near the “ruins” (aiath).
the army will walk on the “threshing floor” (migron).
it will keep its food in the “storehouse” (micmash).
the army will cross the river at the “crossing” (maabarah) and sleep at geba.
ramah will be afraid.
the people at gibeah of saul will run away.
cry out, bath gallim!
laishah, listen!
anathoth, answer me!
the people of madmenah are running away.
the people of gebim are hiding.
this day the army will stop at nob and prepare to fight against mount zion, the hill of jerusalem.
look, the lord god all-powerful will use his great power and chop down that great tree.
their highest officials will be brought down.
their most important leaders will be humbled.
god will cut down his enemies.
like the tall trees of lebanon he will cut them down with an ax.
2 samuel.
chapter 13.
david had a son named absalom.
absalom had a very beautiful sister named tamar.
another one of david’s sons, amnon, was in love with tamar.
she was a virgin.
amnon wanted her very much, but he did not think it was possible for him to have her.
he thought about her so much that he made himself sick.
amnon had a friend named jonadab son of shimeah.
(shimeah was david’s brother.)
jonadab was a very clever man.
he said to amnon, “you are the king’s son.
so why do you always look so sad?
tell me what the trouble is!” amnon told jonadab, “i love tamar.
but she is the sister of my half-brother absalom.” 
jonadab said to amnon, “go to bed.
pretend you are sick.
then your father will come to see you.
tell him, ‘please let my sister tamar come in and give me food to eat.
let her make the food in front of me.
then i will see it and eat it from her hand.’” 
so amnon lay down in bed and pretended to be sick.
king david came in to see amnon.
he said to king david, “please let my sister tamar come in.
let her make two cakes for me while i watch.
then i can eat from her hands.” 
david sent messengers to tamar’s house.
they told her, “go to your brother amnon’s house and make some food for him.” 
so tamar went to the house of her brother amnon.
he was in bed.
tamar took some dough, pressed it together with her hands, and cooked the cakes.
she did this while he watched.
then tamar took the cakes out of the pan and set them out for him.
but he refused to eat.
he said to his servants, “get out of here.
leave me alone!” so all of his servants left the room.
then amnon said to tamar, “bring the food into the bedroom and feed me by hand.” so tamar took the cakes she had made and went into her brother’s bedroom.
she started to feed amnon, but he grabbed her hand.
he said to her, “sister, come and sleep with me.” 
tamar said to amnon, “no, brother!
don’t force me to do this.
don’t do this shameful thing!
terrible things like this should never be done in israel!
i would never get rid of my shame, and people would think that you are just a common criminal.
please, talk with the king.
he will let you marry me.” 
but amnon refused to listen to tamar.
he was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sexual relations with him.
then amnon began to hate tamar.
he hated her much more than he had loved her before.
amnon said to her, “get up and get out of here!” 
tamar said to amnon, “no!
don’t send me away like this.
that would be even worse than what you did before!” but amnon refused to listen to tamar.
he called his servant and said, “get this girl out of this room, now!
and lock the door after her.” 
so amnon’s servant led tamar out of the room and locked the door.
tamar was wearing a long robe with many colors.
the king’s virgin daughters wore robes like this.
tamar tore her robe of many colors and put ashes on her head.
then she put her hand on her head and began crying.
then tamar’s brother absalom said to her, “have you been with your brother amnon?
did he hurt you?
now, calm down sister.
amnon is your brother, so we will take care of this.
don’t let it upset you too much.” so tamar did not say anything.
she quietly went to live at absalom’s house.
king david heard the news and became very angry, but he did not want to say anything to upset amnon, because he loved him since he was his firstborn son.
absalom began to hate amnon.
absalom did not say one word, good or bad, to amnon, but he hated him because amnon had raped his sister tamar.
two years later, absalom had some men come to baal hazor to cut the wool from his sheep.
he invited all the king’s sons to come and watch.
absalom went to the king and said, “i have some men coming to cut the wool from my sheep.
please come with your servants and watch.” 
king david said to absalom, “no, son.
we will not all go.
it will be too much trouble for you.” absalom begged david to go.
david did not go, but he did give his blessing.
absalom said, “if you don’t want to go, please let my brother amnon go with me.” king david asked absalom, “why should he go with you?” 
absalom kept begging david.
finally, david let amnon and all the king’s other sons go with absalom.
then absalom gave this command to his servants, “watch amnon.
when he is drunk and feeling good from the wine, i will give you the command.
you must attack amnon and kill him.
don’t be afraid of being punished.
after all, you will only be obeying my command.
now, be strong and brave.” 
so absalom’s young soldiers did what he said.
they killed amnon.
but all of david’s other sons escaped.
each son got on his mule and escaped.
the king’s sons were still on their way into town.
but king david got a message about what happened.
but the message was, “absalom has killed all the king’s sons!
not one of the sons was left alive.” 
king david tore his clothes and lay on the ground.
all of david’s officers standing near him also tore their clothes.
but then jonadab, the son of david’s brother shimeah, said, “don’t think that all the king’s sons were killed!
only amnon is dead.
absalom has been planning this from the day that amnon raped his sister tamar.
my lord and king, don’t think that all of your sons are dead.
only amnon is dead.” 
absalom ran away.
there was a guard standing on the city wall.
he saw many people coming from the other side of the hill, and went to tell the king.
so jonadab said to king david, “look, i was right!
the king’s sons are coming.” 
the king’s sons came in just after jonadab said that.
they were crying loudly.
david and all of his officers began crying.
they all cried very hard.
david cried for his son every day.
absalom ran away to talmai son of ammihud, the king of geshur.
after absalom had run away to geshur, he stayed there for three years.
king david was comforted after amnon died, but he missed absalom very much.
chapter 143.
a praise song of david.
lord, hear my prayer.
listen to my call for help and answer my prayer.
show me how good and loyal you are.
don’t judge me, your servant.
no one alive could be judged innocent by your standards.
my enemies are chasing me.
they have crushed me into the dirt.
they are pushing me into the dark grave, like people who died long ago.
i am ready to give up.
i am losing my courage.
but i remember what happened long ago.
i am thinking about all you have done.
i am talking about what you made with your hands!
i lift my hands in prayer to you.
i am waiting for your help, like a dry land waiting for rain.
selah 
hurry and answer me, lord!
i have lost my courage.
don’t turn away from me.
don’t let me die and become like the people lying in the grave.
show me your faithful love this morning.
i trust in you.
show me what i should do.
i put my life in your hands!
lord, i come to you for protection.
save me from my enemies.
show me what you want me to do.
you are my god.
let your good spirit lead me over level ground.
lord, let me live so that people will praise your name.
show me how good you are and save me from my trouble.
show me your love and defeat my enemies.
destroy those who are trying to kill me because i am your servant.

chapter 20.
in the spring, joab led the army of israel out to battle.
that was the time of year when kings went out to battle, but david stayed in jerusalem.
the army of israel went to the country of ammon and destroyed it.
then they went to the city of rabbah.
the army camped around the city—they stayed there to keep people from going in or out of the city.
joab and the army of israel fought against the city of rabbah until they destroyed it.
david took the crown from their king’s head.
that gold crown weighed about 75 pounds and there were valuable stones in it.
the crown was put on david’s head.
then david had a great many valuable things brought out of the city of rabbah.
he brought out the people in rabbah and forced them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes.
he did the same thing to all the cities of the ammonites.
then david and all the army went back to jerusalem.
later, the israelites went to war with the philistines at the town of gezer.
at that time sibbecai from hushah killed sippai, who was one of the sons of the giants.
so those philistines became like slaves to the israelites.
another time when the israelites fought against the philistines, elhanan son of jair killed lahmi.
lahmi was goliath’s brother.
goliath was from the town of gath.
lahmi’s spear was very big and heavy.
it was like the large pole on a loom.
later, the israelites fought another war with the philistines at the town of gath.
in this town there was a very large man.
he had 24 fingers and toes.
he had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot.
he also was a son of the giants.
so when that man made fun of israel, jonathan killed him.
jonathan was shimea’s son.
shimea was david’s brother.
these philistine men were sons of the giants from the town of gath.
david and his servants killed those giants.
chapter 2.
the lord said to moses and aaron: 
“the israelites should make their camps around the meeting tent.
each division will have its own special flag, and everyone will camp near their group’s flag.
“the flag of the camp of judah will be on the east side, where the sun rises.
the people of judah will camp near its flag.
the leader of the people of judah is nahshon son of amminadab.
there are 74,600 men in his division.
“the tribe of issachar will camp next to the tribe of judah.
the leader of the tribe of issachar is nethanel son of zuar.
there are 54,400 men in his division.
“the tribe of zebulun will also camp next to the tribe of judah.
the leader of the tribe of zebulun is eliab son of helon.
there are 57,400 men in his division.
“the total number of men in judah’s camp is 186,400. all these men are divided into their different tribes.
judah will be the first group to move when the people travel from one place to another.
“the flag of reuben’s camp will be south of the holy tent.
each group will camp near its flag.
the leader of the tribe of reuben is elizur son of shedeur.
there are 46,500 men in this division.
“the tribe of simeon will camp next to the tribe of reuben.
the leader of the tribe of simeon is shelumiel son of zurishaddai.
there are 59,300 men in this division.
“the tribe of gad will also camp next to the tribe of reuben.
the leader of the tribe of gad is eliasaph son of deuel.
there are 45,650 men in this division.
“the total number of men in all the divisions of reuben’s camp is 151,450. his camp will be the second group to move when the people travel from place to place.
“when the people travel, levi’s camp will move next.
the meeting tent will be with them between the other camps.
the people will make their camps in the same order that they move.
“the flag of the camp of ephraim will be on the west side.
the division of ephraim will camp there.
the leader of the tribe of ephraim is elishama son of ammihud.
there are 40,500 men in this division.
“the tribe of manasseh will camp next to ephraim’s family.
the leader of the tribe of manasseh is gamaliel son of pedahzur.
there are 32,200 men in this division.
“the tribe of benjamin will also camp next to ephraim’s family.
the leader of the tribe of benjamin is abidan son of gideoni.
there are 35,400 men in this division.
“the total number of men in ephraim’s camp is 108,100. they will be the third family to move when the people travel from one place to another.
“the flag of dan’s camp will be on the north side.
the tribes of dan will camp there.
the leader of the tribe of dan is ahiezer son of ammishaddai.
there are 62,700 men in this division.
“the people from the tribe of asher will camp next to the tribe of dan.
the leader of the tribe of asher is pagiel son of ocran.
there are 41,500 men in this division.
“the tribe of naphtali will also camp next to the tribe of dan.
the leader of the tribe of naphtali is ahira son of enan.
there are 53,400 men in this division.
“there are 157,600 men in dan’s camp.
they will be the last to move when the people travel from place to place.
each group will have its own flag.” 
so these were the israelites.
they were counted by families.
the total number of israelite men in the camps, counted by divisions, is 603,550. 
moses obeyed the lord and did not count the levites with the other israelites.
so the israelites did everything the lord told moses.
each group camped under its own flag.
and everyone stayed with their own family and family group.
chapter 3.
then naomi, ruth’s mother-in-law, said to her, “my daughter, maybe i should find a husband and a good home for you.
that would be good for you.
boaz is our close relative.
you worked with his women servants.
tonight he will be working at the threshing floor.
go wash yourself and get dressed.
put on a nice dress, and go down to the threshing floor.
but don’t let boaz see you until he has finished eating his dinner.
after he eats, he will lie down to rest.
watch him so that you will know where he lies down.
go there and lift the cover off his feet.
then lie down there with boaz.
he will tell you what you should do about marriage.” 
then ruth answered, “i will do what you say.” 
so ruth went down to the threshing floor and did everything that her mother-in-law told her to do.
after eating and drinking, boaz was very satisfied.
he went to lie down near the pile of grain.
then ruth went to him very quietly and lifted the cover from his feet and lay down by his feet.
about midnight, boaz rolled over in his sleep and woke up.
he was very surprised.
there was a woman lying near his feet.
boaz said, “who are you?” she said, “i am ruth, your servant girl.
spread your cover over me.
you are my protector.” 
then boaz said, “may the lord bless you, young woman.
you have been very kind to me.
your kindness to me is greater than the kindness you showed to naomi in the beginning.
you could have looked for a young man to marry, rich or poor.
but you did not.
now, young woman, don’t be afraid.
i will do what you ask.
all the people in our town know that you are a very good woman.
and it is true that i am a close relative.
but there is a man who is a closer relative to you than i am.
stay here tonight.
in the morning we will see if he will help you.
if he decides to help you, that is fine.
if he refuses to help, i promise, as surely as the lord lives, i will marry you and buy back elimelech’s land for you.
so lie here until morning.” 
so ruth lay near boaz’s feet until morning.
she got up while it was still dark, before it was light enough for people to recognize each other.
boaz said to her, “we will keep it a secret that you came here to me last night.” 
then he said, “bring me your coat.
now, hold it open.” so ruth held her coat open, and boaz measured out about a bushel of barley as a gift to naomi, her mother-in-law.
boaz then wrapped it in ruth’s coat, and put it on her back.
then he went to the city.
ruth went to the home of her mother-in-law, naomi.
naomi went to the door and asked, “who’s there?” ruth went in telling naomi everything that boaz did for her.
she said, “boaz gave me this barley as a gift for you.
he said that i must not go home without bringing a gift for you.” 
naomi said, “daughter, be patient until we hear what happens.
boaz will not rest until he has finished doing what he should do.
we will know what will happen before the day is ended.” 
ezekiel.
chapter 35.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, look toward mount seir and speak against it for me.
say to it, ‘this is what the lord god says: “‘i am against you, mount seir!
i will punish you and make you an empty wasteland.
i will destroy your cities, and you will become empty.
then you will know that i am the lord.
because you have always been against my people.
you used your sword against israel at the time of their trouble, at the time of their final punishment.’” 
so the lord god says, “but i promise by my own life that i will let death have you.
death will chase you.
you did not hate killing people, so death will chase you.
i will make mount seir an empty ruin.
i will kill everyone who enters or leaves that city.
i will cover its mountains with those who are killed.
there will be dead bodies all over your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
i will make you empty forever.
no one will live in your cities.
then you will know that i am the lord.” 
you said, “these two nations and countries, israel and judah, will be mine.
we will take them for our own.” but the lord is there!
and the lord god says, “you were jealous of my people.
you were angry and hateful to them.
so by my life, i swear that i will punish you the same way you hurt them!
i will punish you and let my people know that i am with them.
and then you, too, will know that i am the lord.
“i have heard you making fun of israel’s hill country.
you said, ‘it is in ruins, just waiting for us to swallow it up.’ 
your proud boasting is really against me.
time after time you have insulted me, and i have heard every word.” 
this is what the lord god says: “all the earth will be happy when i destroy you.
you were happy when the country of israel was destroyed.
i will treat you the same way.
mount seir and the whole country of edom will be destroyed.
then you will know that i am the lord.” 
psalm.
chapter 105.
give thanks to the lord and call out to him!
tell the nations what he has done!
sing to him; sing praises to him.
tell about the amazing things he has done.
be proud of his holy name.
you followers of the lord, be happy!
depend on the lord for strength.
always go to him for help.
remember the amazing things he has done.
remember his miracles and his fair decisions.
you belong to the family of his servant abraham.
you are descendants of jacob, the people god chose.
the lord is our god.
he rules the whole world.
he will remember his agreement forever.
he will always keep the promises he made to his people.
he will keep the agreement he made with abraham and the promise he made to isaac.
he gave it as a law to jacob.
he gave it to israel as an agreement that will last forever!
he said, “i will give you the land of canaan.
it will be your very own.” 
at the time god said this, there were only a few of his people, and they were strangers there.
they traveled around from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
but the lord did not let anyone mistreat them.
he warned kings not to harm them.
he said, “don’t hurt my chosen people.
don’t harm my prophets.” 
he caused a famine in that country, and people did not have enough food.
but he sent a man named joseph to go ahead of them.
joseph was sold like a slave.
they tied a rope around his feet and put an iron ring around his neck.
joseph was a slave until what he said had really happened.
the lord’s message proved that joseph was right.
so the king of egypt set him free.
that nation’s leader let him out of jail.
he put joseph in charge of his house.
joseph took care of everything the king owned.
joseph gave instructions to the other leaders.
he taught the older men.
then israel came to egypt.
jacob lived there in ham’s country.
jacob’s family became very large and more powerful than their enemies.
so the egyptians began to hate his people.
they made plans against his servants.
so the lord sent moses, his servant, and aaron, his chosen priest.
he used moses and aaron to do many miracles in ham’s country.
he sent darkness to cover their land, but the egyptians did not listen to him.
so he changed the water into blood, and all their fish died.
their country was filled with frogs, even in the king’s bedroom.
the lord gave the command, and the flies and gnats came.
they were everywhere!
he made the rain become hail.
lightning struck throughout their land.
he destroyed their vines and fig trees.
he destroyed every tree in their country.
he gave the command, and the locusts and grasshoppers came.
there were too many to count!
they ate all the plants in the country, including all the crops in their fields.
then the lord killed every firstborn in their country.
he killed their oldest sons.
he led his people out of egypt.
they were carrying gold and silver, and none of them stumbled or fell behind.
egypt was happy to see his people go, because they were afraid of them.
the lord spread out his cloud like a blanket.
he used his column of fire to give his people light at night.
they asked for food, and he sent them quail.
he also gave them plenty of bread from heaven.
he split the rock, and water came bubbling out.
a river began flowing in the desert!
the lord remembered his holy promise that he had made to his servant abraham.
he brought his people out of egypt.
they came out rejoicing and singing their happy songs!
then he gave his people the lands of other nations.
his people got what others had worked for.
he did this so that his people would obey his laws and follow his teachings.
praise the lord!
chapter 126.
a song for going up to the temple.
it will be like a dream when the lord comes back with the captives of zion.
we will laugh and sing happy songs!
then the other nations will say, “the lord did a great thing for zion!” 
yes, we will be happy because the lord did a great thing for us.
so, lord, bring back the good times, like a desert stream filled again with flowing water.
then those who were sad when they planted will be happy when they gather the harvest!
those who cried as they carried the seeds will be happy when they bring in the crops!
chapter 1.
this is the vision of isaiah son of amoz.
god showed isaiah what would happen to judah and jerusalem.
isaiah saw this during the time when uzziah, jotham, ahaz, and hezekiah were kings of judah.
heaven and earth, listen!
this is what the lord says: “i raised my children and helped them grow up, but they have turned against me.
a bull knows its master, and a donkey knows where its owner feeds it.
but israel does not know me.
my people do not understand.” 
oh, what a sinful nation!
their guilt is like a heavy weight that they must carry.
they are evil, destructive children.
they left the lord and insulted the holy one of israel.
they turned away and treated him like a stranger.
what good will it do to keep punishing you?
you will continue to rebel.
your whole head and heart are already sick and aching.
from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, every part of your body has wounds, cuts, and open sores.
you have not taken care of them.
your wounds have not been cleaned and bandaged.
your land is in ruins, and your cities are in flames.
your enemies have taken your land, and foreigners are taking what it produces.
it looks like some foreigners destroyed it.
the city of jerusalem is now like an empty shed left in a vineyard.
it is like an old straw hut abandoned in a field of cucumbers or like a city surrounded by enemies.
if the lord all-powerful had not allowed a few people to live, we would have been destroyed completely like the cities of sodom and gomorrah.
and that almost happened!
you officers of sodom, listen to the lord’s message.
you people of gomorrah, listen to god’s teaching.
the lord says, “why do you continue giving me all these sacrifices?
i have had enough of your sacrifices of rams and the fat from well-fed animals.
i don’t want the blood of those bulls, sheep, and goats.
when you people come to meet with me, you trample everything in my yard.
who told you to do this?
“don’t keep bringing me those worthless sacrifices.
i hate the incense you give me.
i cannot stand your festivals for the new moon, the sabbath, and other special meeting days.
i hate the evil you do during those holy times together.
i hate your monthly meetings and councils.
they have become like heavy weights to me, and i am tired of carrying them.
“when you raise your arms to pray to me, i will refuse to look at you.
you will say more and more prayers, but i will refuse to listen because your hands are covered with blood.
“wash yourselves and make yourselves clean.
stop doing the evil things i see you do.
stop doing wrong.
learn to do good.
treat people fairly.
punish those who hurt others.
speak up for the widows and orphans.
argue their cases for them in court.” 
“i, the lord, am the one speaking to you.
come, let’s discuss this.
even if your sins are as dark as red dye, that stain can be removed and you will be as pure as wool that is as white as snow.
“if you listen to what i say, you will get the good things from this land.
but if you refuse to listen and rebel against me, your enemies will destroy you.” the lord himself said this.
look at jerusalem.
she was a faithful city.
what made her become like a prostitute?
in the past, jerusalem was filled with justice, and goodness should live there now.
instead, there are murderers.
once you were like pure silver, but now you are like the impurities that people throw away when the silver is purified.
you are like good wine that has been weakened with water.
your rulers are rebels and friends of thieves.
they demand bribes and accept money for doing wrong.
they take money to cheat people, and they don’t speak up for widows and orphans.
they will not even listen to their cries for help.
because of this, the lord god all-powerful, the mighty one of israel, says, “look, i will get relief from my enemies.
you will not cause me any more trouble.
people use lye to clean silver.
in the same way, i will clean away all your wrongs.
i will remove all the impurities from you.
i will bring back the kind of judges you had in the beginning.
your counselors will be like those you had long ago.
then you will be called ‘the good and faithful city.’” 
god is good and does what is right, so he will rescue zion and the people who come back to him.
but all the criminals and sinners will be destroyed.
those who stopped following the lord will be removed.
in the future, you will be ashamed of the oak trees and special gardens you chose to worship, 
because you will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying.
you will be like a garden dying without water.
powerful people will be like small, dry pieces of wood, and what they did will be like the sparks that start a fire.
these people and their works will both burn up, and no one will be able to put out that fire.
1 samuel.
chapter 10.
samuel took a jar of the special oil and poured the oil on saul’s head.
samuel kissed saul and said, “the lord has anointed you to be the leader over the people who belong to him.
you will control the people.
you will save them from the enemies that are all around them.
he has anointed you to be ruler over his people.
here is a sign that will prove this is true: 
after you leave me today, you will meet two men near rachel’s tomb on the border of benjamin at zelzah.
the two men will say to you, ‘someone found the donkeys you were looking for.
your father stopped worrying about his donkeys.
now he is worrying about you.
he is saying: what will i do about my son?’” 
samuel said, “then you will go until you come to the large oak tree at tabor.
three men will meet you there.
they will be on their way to worship god at bethel.
one man will be carrying three young goats.
the second man will be carrying three loaves of bread.
and the third man will have a leather bag full of wine.
these three men will say hello to you.
they will offer you two bread offerings reserved for priests, and you will accept that bread.
then you will go to gibeath elohim.
there is a philistine fort in that place.
when you come to this town, a group of prophets will come out.
these prophets will come down from the place for worship.
they will be prophesying.
they will be playing harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres.
then the lord’s spirit will come on you with great power.
you will be changed.
you will be like a different man.
you will begin to prophesy with these prophets.
after that happens, you can do whatever you choose to do, because god will be with you.
“go to gilgal before me.
then i will come there to you.
and i will offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
but you must wait seven days.
then i will come and tell you what to do.” 
just as saul turned to leave samuel, god turned saul’s life around.
all these things happened that day.
when saul and his servant came to gibeath elohim, saul met a group of prophets.
god’s spirit came on saul with great power, and saul prophesied with the prophets.
some of the people who had known saul before saw him prophesying with the prophets.
so they asked each other, “what has happened to kish’s son?
is saul also one of the prophets?” 
a man living in gibeath elohim said, “yes, and it seems that he is their leader.” that is why this became a famous saying: “is saul also one of the prophets?” 
after saul finished prophesying, he went to the place of worship.
saul’s uncle asked saul and his servant, “where have you been?” saul said, “we were looking for the donkeys.
when we couldn’t find them, we went to see samuel.” 
saul’s uncle said, “please tell me, what did samuel say to you?” 
saul answered, “samuel told us the donkeys were already found.” he did not tell his uncle everything.
saul did not tell him what samuel said about the kingdom.
samuel told all the israelites to meet together with the lord at mizpah.
samuel told the israelites, “the lord, the god of israel says, ‘i led israel out of egypt.
i saved you from egypt’s control and from the other kingdoms that tried to hurt you.’ 
but today you have rejected your god.
your god saves you from all your troubles and problems.
but you said, ‘no, we want a king to rule us.’ now come, stand before the lord in your family groups and tribes.” 
samuel brought all the tribes of israel near.
then samuel began to choose the new king.
first, the tribe of benjamin was chosen.
samuel told each family in the tribe of benjamin to pass by.
matri’s family was chosen.
then samuel told each man in matri’s family to walk by.
saul son of kish was chosen.
but when the people looked for saul, they could not find him.
then they asked the lord, “has saul come here yet?” the lord said, “saul is hiding behind the supplies.” 
the people ran and took saul out from behind the supplies.
saul stood up among the people.
he was a head taller than anyone else.
samuel said to all the people, “see the man the lord has chosen.
there is no one like saul among the people.” then the people shouted, “long live the king!” 
samuel explained the rules of the kingdom to the people.
he wrote the rules in a book and put the book before the lord.
then samuel told the people to go home.
saul also went to his home in gibeah.
god touched the hearts of brave men who then began to follow saul.
but some troublemakers said, “how can this man save us?” they said bad things about saul and refused to bring gifts to him.
but saul said nothing.
king nahash of the ammonites had been hurting the tribes of gad and reuben.
nahash poked out the right eye of each of the men and did not allow anyone to help them.
he poked out the right eye of every israelite man living in the area east of the jordan river.
but 7000 israelite men ran away from the ammonites and came to jabesh gilead.
chapter 28.
a song of david.
lord, you are my rock.
i am calling to you for help.
don’t close your ears to my prayers.
if you don’t answer me, i will be counted among the dead.
i lift my hands and pray toward your most holy place.
hear me when i call to you.
show mercy to me.
don’t treat me like the evil people who do wicked things.
they greet their neighbors like friends, but secretly plan to hurt them.
they do bad things to others, so make bad things happen to them.
give them the punishment they deserve.
they don’t notice what the lord does.
they ignore all the good things he has made.
so instead of building them up, he will destroy them.
praise the lord!
he has heard my prayer for mercy.
the lord is my strength and shield.
i trusted him with all my heart.
he helped me, so i am happy.
i sing songs of praise to him.
the lord protects his chosen one.
he saves him and gives him strength.
save your people.
bless those who belong to you.
lead them and honor them forever.
chapter 9.
god blessed noah and his sons and said to them, “have many children.
fill the earth with your people.
every animal on earth, every bird in the air, every animal that crawls on the ground, and every fish in the sea will be afraid of you.
all of them will be under your control.
in the past, i gave you the green plants to eat.
now every animal will also be food for you.
i give you everything on earth—it is yours.
but i give you one command.
you must not eat meat that still has its life (blood) in it.
also, i will demand your blood for your lives.
that is, i will demand the life of any person or animal that takes a human life.
“god made humans to be like himself.
so whoever kills a person must be killed by another person.
“have many children and fill the earth with your people.” 
then god said to noah and his sons, 
“i now make my promise to you and to your people who will live after you.
i make my promise to all the birds, and to all the cattle, and to all the animals that came out of the boat with you.
i make my promise to every living thing on earth.
this is my promise to you: all life on the earth was destroyed by the flood.
but that will never happen again.
a flood will never again destroy all life on the earth.” 
and god said, “i will give you something to prove that i made this promise to you.
it will continue forever to show that i have made an agreement with you and every living thing on earth.
i am putting a rainbow in the clouds as proof of the agreement between me and the earth.
when i bring clouds over the earth, you will see the rainbow in the clouds.
when i see this rainbow, i will remember the agreement between me and you and every living thing on the earth.
this agreement says that a flood will never again destroy all life on the earth.
when i look and see the rainbow in the clouds, i will remember the agreement that continues forever.
i will remember the agreement between me and every living thing on the earth.” 
so god said to noah, “this rainbow is proof of the agreement that i made with all living things on earth.” 
noah’s sons came out of the boat with him.
their names were shem, ham, and japheth.
(ham was the father of canaan.)
these three men were noah’s sons.
and all the people on earth came from these three sons.
noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard.
one day noah made some wine.
he got drunk, went into his tent, and took off all his clothes.
ham, the father of canaan, saw that his father was naked and told his brothers who were outside the tent.
shem and japheth took a robe, put it across their shoulders, and walked backward into the tent.
then they covered their father without looking at him.
later, noah woke up.
(he was sleeping because of the wine.)
when he learned what his youngest son ham had done to him, 
he said, “may there be a curse on canaan!
may he be a slave to his brothers.” 
noah also said, “may the lord, the god of shem, be praised!
may canaan be shem’s slave.
may god give more land to japheth.
may god live in shem’s tents, and may canaan be their slave.” 
after the flood noah lived 350 years.
he lived a total of 950 years; then he died.
chapter 22.
after these things god decided to test abraham’s faith.
god said to him, “abraham!” and he said, “yes!” 
then god said, “take your son to the land of moriah and kill your son there as a sacrifice for me.
this must be isaac, your only son, the one you love.
use him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains there.
i will tell you which mountain.” 
in the morning abraham got up and saddled his donkey.
he took isaac and two servants with him.
he cut the wood for the sacrifice.
then they went to the place where god told them to go.
after they traveled three days, abraham looked up, and in the distance he saw the place where they were going.
then he said to his servants, “stay here with the donkey.
the boy and i will go to that place and worship.
then we will come back to you later.” 
abraham took the wood for the sacrifice and put it on his son’s shoulder.
abraham took the special knife and fire.
then both he and his son went together to the place for worship.
isaac said to his father abraham, “father!” abraham answered, “yes, son?” isaac said, “i see the wood and the fire.
but where is the lamb we will burn as a sacrifice?” 
abraham answered, “god himself is providing the lamb for the sacrifice, my son.” so both abraham and his son went together to that place.
when they came to the place where god told them to go, abraham built an altar.
he carefully laid the wood on the altar.
then he tied up his son isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.
then abraham reached for his knife to kill his son.
but the angel of the lord stopped him.
the angel called from heaven and said, “abraham, abraham!” abraham answered, “yes?” 
the angel said, “don’t kill your son or hurt him in any way.
now i can see that you do respect and obey god.
i see that you are ready to kill your son, your only son, for me.” 
then abraham noticed a ram whose horns were caught in a bush.
so abraham went and took the ram.
he offered it, instead of his son, as a sacrifice to god.
so abraham gave that place a name, “the lord provides.” even today people say, “on the mountain of the lord, he will give us what we need.” 
the angel of the lord called to abraham from heaven a second time.
the angel said, “you were ready to kill your only son for me.
since you did this for me, i make you this promise: i, the lord, promise that 
i will surely bless you and give you as many descendants as the stars in the sky.
there will be as many people as sand on the seashore.
and your people will live in cities that they will take from their enemies.
every nation on the earth will be blessed through your descendants.
i will do this because you obeyed me.” 
then abraham went back to his servants.
they all traveled back to beersheba, and abraham stayed there.
after all these things happened, a message was sent to abraham.
it said, “your brother nahor and his wife milcah have children now.
the first son is uz.
the second son is buz.
the third son is kemuel, the father of aram.
then there are kesed, hazo, pildash, jidlaph, and bethuel.” 
bethuel was the father of rebekah.
milcah was the mother of these eight sons, and nahor was the father.
nahor was abraham’s brother.
also nahor had four other sons from his slave woman reumah.
the sons were tebah, gaham, tahash, and maacah.
chapter 43.
jacob, the lord created you.
israel, he made you, and now he says, “don’t be afraid.
i saved you.
i named you.
you are mine.
when you have troubles, i am with you.
when you cross rivers, you will not be hurt.
when you walk through fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not hurt you.
that’s because i, the lord, am your god.
i, the holy one of israel, am your savior.
i gave egypt to pay for you.
i gave ethiopia and seba to make you mine.
you are precious to me, and i have given you a special place of honor.
i love you.
that’s why i am willing to trade others, to give up whole nations, to save your life.
“so don’t be afraid, because i am with you.
i will gather your children and bring them to you.
i will gather them from the east and from the west.
i will tell the north: give my people to me.
i will tell the south: don’t keep my people in prison.
bring my sons and daughters to me from the faraway places.
bring to me all the people who are mine—the people who have my name.
i made them for myself.
i made them, and they are mine.
“bring out the people who have eyes but are blind.
bring out the people who have ears but are deaf.
all people and all nations should also be gathered together.
which of their gods said this would happen?
which of their gods would tell what happened in the beginning?
they should bring their witnesses.
the witnesses should speak the truth.
this will show they are right.” 
the lord says, “you people are my witnesses and the servant i chose.
i chose you so that you would help people believe me.
i chose you so that you would understand that ‘i am he’—i am the true god.
there was no god before me, and there will be no god after me.
i myself am the lord, and there is no other savior.
i am the one who spoke to you, saved you, and told you those things.
it was not some stranger who was with you.
you are my witnesses, and i am god.” (this is what the lord himself said.)
“i have always been god.
when i do something, no one can change what i have done.
and no one can save people from my power.” 
the lord, the holy one of israel, saves you, and he says, “i will send armies to babylon for you.
many people will be captured.
those chaldeans will be taken away in their own boats.
(they are so proud of those boats.)
i am the lord your holy one.
i made israel.
i am your king.” 
the lord is making roads through the sea.
he is making a path for his people, even through rough waters.
the lord says, 
“those who fight against me with their chariots, horses, and armies will be defeated.
they will never rise again.
they will be destroyed.
they will be put out like the flame in a lamp.
so don’t remember what happened in earlier times.
don’t think about what happened a long time ago, 
because i am doing something new!
now you will grow like a new plant.
surely you know this is true.
i will even make a road in the desert, and rivers will flow through that dry land.
the wild animals will thank me.
the large animals and birds will honor me when i put water in the desert and make rivers flow through that dry land.
i will do this to give water to my chosen people.
i made them, and they will sing songs of praise to me.
“jacob, you did not pray to me.
israel, you became tired of me.
you have not brought your sheep as sacrifices to me.
you have not honored me with your sacrifices.
i did not force you to give gifts to me like slaves.
i did not force you to burn incense until you became tired.
so you did not use your money to buy things to honor me.
but you did force me to be like your slave.
you sinned until the bad things you did made me very tired.
“i, i am the one who wipes away all your sins.
i do this to please myself.
i will not remember your sins.
but you should remember me.
let’s meet together and decide what is right.
tell your story and prove that you are innocent.
your first father sinned, and your lawyers committed crimes against me.
i will make your temple leaders unfit to serve there.
i will destroy jacob.
bad things will happen to israel.
chapter 3.
then the lord spoke to jonah again and said, 
“go to that big city nineveh, and say what i tell you.” 
so jonah obeyed the lord and went to nineveh.
it was a very large city.
a person had to walk for three days to travel through it.
jonah went to the center of the city and began speaking to the people.
he said, “after 40 days, nineveh will be destroyed!” 
the people of nineveh believed god.
they decided to stop eating for a time to think about their sins.
they put on special clothes to show they were sorry.
all the people in the city did this, from the most important to the least important.
when the king of nineveh heard about this, he left his throne, removed his robe, put on special clothes to show that he was sorry, and sat in ashes.
the king wrote a special message and sent it throughout the city: a command from the king and his great rulers: for a short time no person or animal should eat anything.
no herd or flock will be allowed in the fields.
nothing living in nineveh will eat or drink water.
but every person and every animal must be covered with a special cloth to show they are sad.
people must cry loudly to god.
everyone must change their life and stop doing bad things.
who knows?
maybe god will stop being angry and change his mind, and we will not be punished.
god saw what the people did.
he saw that they stopped doing evil.
so god changed his mind and did not do what he planned.
he did not punish the people.
chapter 2.
blow the trumpet on zion.
shout a warning on my holy mountain.
let all the people who live in the land shake with fear.
the lord’s special day is coming; it is near.
it will be a dark, gloomy day.
it will be a dark and cloudy day.
at sunrise you will see the army spread over the mountains.
it will be a great and powerful army.
there has never been anything like it before, and there will never be anything like it again.
the army will destroy the land like a burning fire.
in front of them the land will be like the garden of eden.
behind them the land will be like an empty desert.
nothing will escape them.
they look like horses.
they run like war horses.
listen to them.
it is like the noise of chariots riding over the mountains.
it is like the noise of flames burning the chaff.
they are a powerful people, who are ready for war.
before this army, people shake with fear.
their faces become pale from fear.
the soldiers run fast.
they climb over the walls.
each soldier marches straight ahead.
they don’t move from their path.
they don’t trip each other.
each soldier walks in his own path.
if one of the soldiers is hit and falls down, the others keep right on marching.
they run to the city.
they quickly climb over the wall.
they climb into the houses.
they climb through the windows like thieves.
before them, earth and sky shake.
the sun and the moon become dark, and the stars stop shining.
the lord calls loudly to his army.
his camp is very large.
the army obeys his commands.
his army is very powerful.
the lord’s special day is a great and terrible day.
no one can stop it.
this is the lord’s message: “now come back to me with all your heart.
cry and mourn, and don’t eat anything!
show that you are sad for doing wrong.
tear your hearts, not your clothes.” come back to the lord your god.
he is kind and merciful.
he does not become angry quickly.
he has great love.
maybe he will change his mind about the bad punishment he planned.
who knows, maybe he will change his mind and leave behind a blessing for you.
then you can give grain and drink offerings to the lord your god.
blow the trumpet at zion.
call for a special meeting.
call for a special time of fasting.
bring the people together.
call for a special meeting.
bring together the old men, the children, and the small babies still at their mother’s breasts.
let the bride and her new husband come from their bedroom.
let the priests, the lord’s servants, cry between the porch and the altar.
all of them should say this: “lord, have mercy on your people.
don’t let your people be put to shame.
don’t let other people tell jokes about your people.
don’t let the other nations laugh at us and say, ‘where is their god?’” 
then the lord cared very much about his land.
he felt sorry for his people.
the lord spoke to his people.
he said, “i will send you grain, wine, and oil.
you will have plenty.
i will not shame you among the nations anymore.
no, i will force the people from the north to leave your land and make them go into a dry, empty land.
some of them will go to the eastern sea and some to the western sea.
they did such terrible things, but they will be like a dead and rotting body.
there will be such a terrible smell!” 
land, don’t be afraid.
be happy and full of joy.
the lord will do great things.
animals of the field, don’t be afraid.
the desert pastures will grow grass.
the trees will grow fruit.
the fig trees and the vines will grow plenty of fruit.
so be happy, people of zion.
be joyful in the lord your god.
he is good and will give you rain.
he will send the early rains and the late rains as before.
the threshing floors will be filled with wheat, and the barrels will overflow with wine and olive oil.
“i, the lord, sent my army against you.
the swarming locusts and the hopping locusts and the destroying locusts and the cutting locusts ate everything you had.
but i will pay you back for those years of trouble.
then you will have plenty to eat.
you will be full.
you will praise the name of the lord your god.
he has done wonderful things for you.
my people will never again be ashamed.
you will know that i am with israel.
you will know that i am the lord your god.
there is no other god.
my people will never be ashamed again.” 
“after this, i will pour out my spirit on all kinds of people.
your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions.
in those days i will pour out my spirit even on servants, both men and women.
i will work wonders in the sky and on the earth.
there will be blood, fire, and thick smoke.
the sun will be changed into darkness, and the moon will be as red as blood.
then the great and fearful day of the lord will come!
and everyone who trusts in the lord will be saved.
there will be survivors on mount zion and in jerusalem, just as the lord said.
yes, those left alive will be the ones the lord has called.
chapter 4.
the lord spoke to moses and said, 
“tell the israelites this: a person might sin without meaning to and do something that the lord commanded should not be done.
for example: 
“if the anointed priest makes a mistake that leaves the people guilty for their sin, he must offer a young bull to the lord as a sin offering.
the bull must have nothing wrong with it.
the anointed priest must bring the bull to the entrance of the meeting tent in front of the lord.
he must put his hand on the bull’s head and kill the bull in front of the lord.
then the anointed priest must get some of the blood from the bull and take it into the meeting tent.
he must put his finger in the blood and sprinkle the blood seven times before the lord in front of the curtain of the most holy place.
the priest must put some of the blood on the corners of the incense altar.
(this altar is in the meeting tent, in front of the lord.)
he must pour out the rest of the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
(this altar is at the entrance of the meeting tent.)
then the priest must take all the fat from the bull of the sin offering.
he must take the fat that is on and around the inner parts.
he must take the two kidneys and the fat covering them near the lower back muscle.
he must also take the fat part of the liver.
he must remove it with the kidneys.
the priest must lift up these things and burn them on the altar for burnt offerings, just as he does for the fellowship offering.
but the priest must carry out the bull’s skin, inner parts and body waste, and all the meat, including the head and legs.
he must carry those parts outside the camp to the special place where the ashes are poured out.
he must put those parts on the wood and burn them there on the ash pile.
“the whole nation of israel might sin without knowing it.
they might break one of the commands of the lord and become guilty of doing something he said must not be done.
when they learn about that sin, the community of israel must offer a young bull as a sin offering for the whole nation.
they must bring the bull to the meeting tent.
the elders of the people must put their hands on the bull’s head in front of the lord.
then they must kill the bull in front of the lord.
the anointed priest must get some of the bull’s blood and take it into the meeting tent.
he must put his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the curtain before the lord.
he must put some of the blood on the corners of the altar.
(this altar is inside the meeting tent, in front of the lord.)
he must then pour out all the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
(this altar is at the entrance of the meeting tent.)
then he must take all the fat from the animal and bring it to the altar.
he must offer these parts, just as he offered the bull of the sin offering.
in this way the priest will make the people pure, and god will forgive them.
the priest must carry this bull outside the camp and burn it, just as he burned the other bull.
this is the sin offering for the whole community.
“a ruler might sin without meaning to and break one of the commands of the lord.
he might do something that his god said must not be done.
if he learns about his sin, he must bring a male goat that has nothing wrong with it as his offering.
the ruler must put his hand on the goat’s head and kill the goat at the place where they kill the burnt offering before the lord.
the goat is a sin offering.
the priest will take some of the blood of the sin offering on his finger and put it on the corners of the altar of burnt offering.
he will pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
the priest will burn all the goat’s fat on the altar, just as he does for the fellowship offerings.
in this way the priest will make the ruler pure, and god will forgive him.
“finally, one of you common people might sin without meaning to.
you might break one of the commands of the lord and become guilty of doing something he said must not be done.
if you learn about that sin, you must bring a female goat that has nothing wrong with it as your sin offering.
you must put your hand on the animal’s head and kill it at the place for the burnt offering.
then the priest will take some of the goat’s blood on his finger and put it on the corners of the altar of burnt offering.
he will pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
the priest will then remove all of its fat, just as he does for the fellowship offerings.
then he will bring it to the altar as a sweet smell to the lord.
the priest will do this to make you pure, and god will forgive you.
“if you bring a lamb as your sin offering, then you must bring a female lamb that has nothing wrong with it.
you must put your hand on the animal’s head and kill it as a sin offering in the place where people kill the burnt offering.
the priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering on his finger and put it on the corners of the altar of burnt offering.
he will pour out the rest of the lamb’s blood at the base of the altar.
he will then remove all the lamb’s fat, just as he does for the fellowship offerings.
then he will bring it to the altar as a gift to the lord.
the priest will do this to make you pure, and god will forgive you.
chapter 5.
to the director: with flutes.
a song of david.
lord, listen to me and understand what i am trying to say.
my god and king, listen to my prayer.
every morning, lord, i lay my gifts before you and look to you for help.
and every morning you hear my prayers.
god, you don’t want evil people near you.
they cannot stay in your presence.
fools cannot come near you.
you hate those who do evil.
you destroy those who tell lies.
lord, you hate those who make secret plans to hurt others.
but by your great mercy, i can enter your house.
i can worship in your holy temple with fear and respect for you.
lord, show me your right way of living, and make it easy for me to follow.
people are looking for my weaknesses, so show me how you want me to live.
my enemies never tell the truth.
they only want to destroy people.
their words come from mouths that are like open graves.
they use their lying tongues to deceive others.
punish them, god!
let them be caught in their own traps.
they have turned against you, so punish them for their many crimes.
but let those who trust in you be happy forever.
protect and strengthen those who love your name.
lord, when you bless good people, you surround them with your love, like a large shield that protects them.

chapter 20.
the lord said to moses, 
“you must also tell the israelites these things: anyone living in israel who gives one of their children to the false god molech must be killed!
it doesn’t matter if they are a citizen of israel or a foreigner, you must throw stones at them and kill them.
i will be against them and separate them from their people, because they gave their children to molech.
they showed that they did not respect my holy name.
and they made my holy place unclean.
maybe the common people will ignore them.
maybe they will not kill those who gave their children to molech.
but i will be against these people and their families.
i will separate them from their people.
i will separate anyone who is unfaithful to me and chases after molech.
“i will be against anyone who goes to mediums and wizards for advice.
whoever does this is being unfaithful to me.
so i will separate them from their people.
“be special.
make yourselves holy, because i am the lord your god.
remember and obey my laws.
i am the lord.
and i have made you my special people.
“whoever curses their father or mother must be put to death.
they cursed their father or mother, so they are responsible for their own death!
“if a man has sexual relations with his neighbor’s wife, both the man and the woman are guilty of adultery and must be put to death!
if a man has sexual relations with his father’s wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.
they are responsible for their own death.
it is as if that man had sexual relations with his father!
“if a man has sexual relations with his daughter-in-law, both of them must be put to death.
they have committed a terrible sexual sin!
they are responsible for their own death.
“if a man has sexual relations with another man as with a woman, they have committed a terrible sin.
they must be put to death.
they are responsible for their own death.
“it is a sexual sin if a man has sexual relations with a woman and her mother.
the people must burn that man and the two women in fire!
don’t let this sexual sin happen among your people.
“if a man has sexual relations with an animal, both the man and the animal must be put to death.
if a woman has sexual relations with an animal, you must kill the woman and the animal.
they must be put to death.
they are responsible for their own death.
“it is a shameful thing for a brother and his sister or half-sister to marry each other and have sexual relations with each other.
they must be punished in public.
they must be separated from their people.
the man who has sexual relations with his sister must be punished for his sin.

don’t eat any of these unclean birds or animals or things that crawl on the ground.
i have made these things unclean.
i have separated you from other nations to be my own special people.
so you must be holy because i am the lord, and i am holy.
“a man or a woman who is a medium or a wizard must be put to death.
the people must kill them with stones.
they are responsible for their own death.” 
isaiah.
chapter 59.
look, the lord’s power is enough to save you.
he can hear you when you ask him for help.
it is your sins that separate you from your god.
he turns away from you when he sees them.
that’s because your hands are covered with blood from the people you murdered.
you tell lies and say evil things.
you can’t be trusted, even in court.
you lie about each other and depend on false arguments to win your cases.
you create pain and produce wickedness.
you hatch evil, like eggs from a poisonous snake.
anyone who eats the eggs will die.
and if you break one of them open, a poisonous snake will come out.
your lies are like spider webs.
they cannot be used for clothes, and you cannot cover yourself with them.
your hands are always busy sinning and hurting others.
your feet run toward evil.
you are always ready to kill innocent people.
you think of nothing but evil.
everywhere you go you cause trouble and ruin.
you don’t know how to live in peace.
you don’t do what is right and fair.
you are crooked, and anyone who lives like that will never know true peace.
all fairness and goodness is gone.
there is only darkness around us, so we must wait for the light.
we hope for a bright light, but all we have is darkness.
we are like people without eyes.
we walk into walls like blind people.
we stumble and fall as if it was night.
even in the daylight, we cannot see.
at noontime, we fall like dead men.
we are always complaining; we growl like bears and moan like doves.
we are waiting for justice, but there is none.
we are waiting to be saved, but salvation is still far away.
that’s because we committed crimes against our god.
our own sins speak out against us.
we know we are guilty.
we know we have sinned.
we rebelled against the lord and lied to him.
we turned away from our god and left him.
we planned to hurt others and to rebel against god.
from hearts filled with lies, we talked about it and made our plans.
we pushed justice away.
fairness stands off in the distance.
truth has fallen in the streets.
goodness is not allowed in the city.
loyalty is gone, and people who try to do good are robbed.
the lord looked and saw there was no justice.
he did not like what he saw.
he did not see anyone speak up for the people.
he was shocked to see that no one stood up for them.
so with his own power he saved them.
his desire to do what is right gave him strength.
he put on the armor of goodness, the helmet of salvation, the uniform of punishment, and the coat of strong love.
he will give his enemies the punishment they deserve.
they will feel his anger.
he will punish all his enemies.
people along the coast will get the punishment they deserve.
people from the west to the east will fear the lord and respect his glory.
he will come quickly, like a fast-flowing river driven by a wind from the lord.
then a redeemer will come to zion to save the people of jacob who have turned away from sin.
the lord says, “as for me, this is the agreement that i will make with these people.
i promise my spirit that i put on you and my words that i put in your mouth will never leave you.
they will be with you and your children and your children’s children, for now and forever.

harim, meremoth, obadiah,

these were the priests who put their names on the sealed agreement.
and these are the levites who put their names on the sealed agreement: jeshua son of azaniah, binnui from the family of henadad, kadmiel, 
and their brothers: shebaniah, hodiah, kelita, pelaiah, hanan, 
mica, rehob, hashabiah, 
zaccur, sherebiah, shebaniah,

and these are the names of the leaders who put their names on the sealed agreement: parosh, pahath-moab, elam, zattu, bani,

rehum, hashabnah, maaseiah, 
ahiah, hanan, anan, 
malluch, harim, and baanah.
so all these people now make this special promise to god.
and they all ask for bad things to happen if they don’t keep their promise.
all these people promise to follow the law of god.
that law of god was given to us through moses his servant.
these people promise with an oath to carefully obey all the commands, rules, and teachings of our lord god.
now, these are the people who are making this promise: the rest of the people—the priests, levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants, and all the israelites who separated themselves from the people living around them.
they have separated themselves to obey god’s law.
their wives, sons, and daughters who are able to listen and understand also did this.
all these people joined their brothers and the important people to accept for themselves the promise to obey god’s law.
and they accepted the curse that asks for bad things to happen to them if they don’t obey god’s law.
“we promise not to let our daughters marry the people living around us.
and we promise not to let our sons marry their daughters.
“we promise not to work on the sabbath day.
if the people living around us bring grain or other things to sell on the sabbath, we will not buy them on that special day or on any other festival.
every seventh year, we will not plant or work the land.
and every seventh year, we will cancel every debt that other people owe to us.
“we will accept the responsibility for obeying the commands to take care of god’s temple.
we will give 1/3 shekel of silver each year to support the temple service to honor our god.
this money will pay for the special bread that the priests put on the table in the temple.
it will pay for the daily grain offerings and burnt offerings.
it will pay for the offerings on the sabbaths, new moon celebrations, and other special meeting days.
it will pay for the holy offerings and for the sin offerings that make the israelites pure.
it will pay for any work needed on the temple of our god.
“we, the priests, the levites, and the people have thrown lots to decide when each of our families is to bring a gift of wood to the temple of our god at certain times each year.
the wood is to burn on the altar of the lord our god.
we must do that just as it is written in the law.
“we also accept the responsibility of bringing the first part of our harvest, whether from the grain in our fields or the fruit from our trees.
we will bring them to the lord’s temple each year.
“just as it is also written in the law, this is what we will do: we will bring our firstborn sons and our firstborn cattle, sheep, and goats.
we will bring these to the temple of our god, to the priests who are serving there.
“and we will also bring the first part of our harvest to priests to put in the storage rooms of our god’s temple.
we will bring the first of our ground meal, the first of our grain offerings, the first fruit from our trees, and the first of our new wine and oil.
and we will bring a tenth of our crops to the levites, because they are the ones who collect these things in all the towns where we work.
a priest from the family of aaron must be with the levites when they receive the crops.
then the levites must bring the crops to the temple of our god and put them in the storerooms of the temple treasury.
the israelites and the levites must bring their gifts to the storerooms.
they are to bring their gifts of grain, new wine, and oil.
all the things for the temple are kept in the storerooms, and that is where the priests who are on duty stay.
the singers and gatekeepers also stay there.
“we all promise that we will take care of the temple of our god.” 
lamentations.
chapter 5.
remember, lord, what happened to us.
look and see our shame.
our land has been turned over to strangers.
our houses have been given to foreigners.
we have become orphans.
we have no father.
our mothers have become like widows.
we have to buy the water that we drink.
we have to pay for the wood that we use.
we are forced to wear a yoke on our necks.
we get tired, and we have no rest.
we made an agreement with egypt.
we also made an agreement with assyria to get enough bread.
our ancestors sinned against you, and now they are dead.
and we are suffering because of their sins.
slaves have become our rulers.
no one can save us from them.
we risk our lives to get food.
there are men in the desert with swords.
our skin is hot like an oven.
we have a high fever because of our hunger.
the enemy raped the women of zion.
they raped the women in the cities of judah.
the enemy hanged our princes.
they didn’t honor our elders.
the enemy made our young men grind grain at the mill.
our young men stumbled under loads of wood.
the elders no longer sit at the gates of the city.
the young men no longer make music.
we have no more joy in our hearts.
our dancing has changed to crying for the dead.
the crown has fallen from our head.
things have gone bad for us because we sinned.
for this reason, our hearts have become sick, and our eyes cannot see clearly.
mount zion is a wasteland.
foxes run around on mount zion.
but you rule forever, lord.
your kingly chair lasts forever and ever.
you seem to have forgotten us forever.
you seem to have left us alone for such a long time.
bring us back to you, lord.
we will gladly come back to you.
make our lives as they were before.
you were very angry with us.
have you completely rejected us?

chapter 12.
jeroboam son of nebat was still in egypt where he had run away from solomon.
when he heard about solomon’s death, he returned to his city, zeredah, in the hills of ephraim.
rehoboam and all the israelites went to shechem to make him the king.
the people said to rehoboam, 
“your father forced us to work very hard.
now, make it easier for us.
stop the heavy work that your father forced us to do and we will serve you.” 
rehoboam answered, “come back to me in three days, and i will answer you.” so the people left.
there were some older men who had helped solomon make decisions when he was alive.
so king rehoboam asked these men what he should do.
he said, “how do you think i should answer the people?” 
they answered, “if you are like a servant to them today, they will sincerely serve you.
if you speak kindly to them, they will always work for you.” 
but rehoboam did not listen to the advice from the older men.
he asked the young men who were his friends.
rehoboam asked them, “the people said, ‘give us easier work than your father gave us.’ how do you think i should answer them?
what should i tell them?” 
then the young men who grew up with him answered, “those people came to you and said, ‘your father forced us to work very hard.
now make our work easier.’ so you should tell them, ‘my little finger is stronger than my father’s whole body.
my father forced you to work hard, but i will make you work much harder!
my father punished you with whips, but i will punish you with whips that have sharp metal tips.’” 
three days later, jeroboam and all the people came back as rehoboam had said.
king rehoboam did not listen to the advice from the older men, and he was rude to the people.
he did what his friends told him to do and said, “my father forced you to work hard, but i will make you work much harder!
my father punished you with whips, but i will punish you with whips that have sharp metal tips.” 
so the king did not do what the people wanted.
the lord caused this to happen.
he did this in order to keep the promise he made to jeroboam son of nebat when he sent the prophet ahijah from shiloh to speak to him.
the israelites saw that the new king refused to listen to them, so they said to him, “we are not part of david’s family are we?
we don’t get any of jesse’s land, do we?
so, people of israel, let’s go home and let david’s son rule his own people!” so the israelites went home.
but rehoboam still ruled over the israelites who lived in the cities of judah.
a man named adoniram was one of the men who directed the workers.
king rehoboam sent adoniram to talk to the people, but the israelites threw stones at him until he died.
king rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to jerusalem.
so israel rebelled against the family of david, and this is how things are even today.
when all the israelites heard that jeroboam had come back, they called him to a meeting and made him king over all israel.
the tribe of judah was the only tribe that continued to follow the family of david.
rehoboam went back to jerusalem and gathered together an army of 180,000 men from the families of judah and the tribe of benjamin.
rehoboam wanted to go fight against the israelites and take back his kingdom.
but god spoke to a prophet named shemaiah.
he said, 
“talk to rehoboam, the son of solomon, king of judah, and to men of judah and benjamin.
say to them, ‘the lord says that you must not go to war against your brothers.
everyone, go home!
i made all this happen.’” so all the men in rehoboam’s army obeyed the lord.
they went home, just as the lord had commanded.
jeroboam rebuilt the city of shechem, in the hill country of ephraim, and lived there.
later he went to the city of penuel and rebuilt it.
jeroboam said to himself, “if the people keep going to jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the lord’s temple, someday they will want to be ruled by their old masters.
they will want to be ruled by king rehoboam of judah.
and then they will kill me.” 
so the king asked his advisors what to do.
they gave him their advice, and king jeroboam made two golden calves.
he said to the people, “you don’t have to go to jerusalem to worship anymore.
israel, these are the gods that brought you out of egypt.” 
king jeroboam put one golden calf in bethel and the other one in the city of dan.
what a terrible sin this was, because the israelites started going to the cities of dan and bethel to worship the calves.
jeroboam also built temples at the high places and chose priests from among the different tribes of israel.
(he did not choose priests only from the tribe of levi.)
then king jeroboam started a new festival that was like the festival in judah, but it was on the 15th day of the eighth month.
at this time the king offered sacrifices on the altar at bethel.
he and the priests he chose offered the sacrifices to the calves that he had set up at the high places he had made.
so king jeroboam chose his own time for a festival for the israelites, the 15th day of the eighth month.
and during that time he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the altar he had built at bethel.
chapter 3.
the snake was the most clever of all the wild animals that the lord god had made.
the snake spoke to the woman and said, “woman, did god really tell you that you must not eat from any tree in the garden?” 
the woman answered the snake, “no, we can eat fruit from the trees in the garden.
but there is one tree we must not eat from.
god told us, ‘you must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden.
you must not even touch that tree, or you will die.’” 
but the snake said to the woman, “you will not die.
god knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree you will learn about good and evil, and then you will be like god!” 
the woman could see that the tree was beautiful and the fruit looked so good to eat.
she also liked the idea that it would make her wise.
so she took some of the fruit from the tree and ate it.
her husband was there with her, so she gave him some of the fruit, and he ate it.
then it was as if their eyes opened, and they saw things differently.
they saw that they were naked.
so they got some fig leaves, sewed them together, and wore them for clothes.
during the cool part of the day, the lord god was walking in the garden.
the man and the woman heard him, and they hid among the trees in the garden.
the lord god called to the man and said, “where are you?” 
the man said, “i heard you walking in the garden, and i was afraid.
i was naked, so i hid.” 
god said to the man, “who told you that you were naked?
did you eat fruit from that special tree?
i told you not to eat from that tree!” 
the man said, “the woman you put here with me gave me fruit from that tree.
so i ate it.” 
then the lord god said to the woman, “what have you done?” she said, “the snake tricked me, so i ate the fruit.” 
so the lord god said to the snake, “you did this very bad thing, so bad things will happen to you.
it will be worse for you than for any other animal.
you must crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.
i will make you and the woman enemies to each other.
your children and her children will be enemies.
you will bite her child’s foot, but he will crush your head.” 
then god said to the woman, “i will cause you to have much trouble when you are pregnant.
and when you give birth to children, you will have much pain.
you will want your husband very much, but he will rule over you.” 
then god said to the man, “i commanded you not to eat from that tree.
but you listened to your wife and ate from it.
so i will curse the ground because of you.
you will have to work hard all your life for the food the ground produces.
the ground will grow thorns and weeds for you.
and you will have to eat the plants that grow wild in the fields.
you will work hard for your food, until your face is covered with sweat.
you will work hard until the day you die, and then you will become dust again.
i used dust to make you, and when you die, you will become dust again.” 
adam named his wife eve.
he gave her this name because eve would be the mother of everyone who ever lived.
the lord god used animal skins and made some clothes for the man and his wife.
then he put the clothes on them.
the lord god said, “look, the man has become like us—he knows about good and evil.
and now the man might take the fruit from the tree of life.
if the man eats that fruit, he will live forever.” 
so the lord god forced the man out of the garden of eden to work the ground he was made from.
god forced the man to leave the garden.
then he put cherub angels and a sword of fire at the entrance to the garden to protect it.
the sword flashed around and around, guarding the way to the tree of life.
chapter 1.
this is a message from the lord to israel.
god used malachi to tell this message to the people.
the lord said, “i love you people.” but you said, “what shows you love us?” the lord said, “esau was jacob’s brother, but i chose jacob.
and i did not accept esau.
i destroyed his hill country.
his country was destroyed, and now only wild dogs live there.” 
the people of edom might say, “we were destroyed, but we will go back and rebuild our cities.” but the lord all-powerful says, “if they rebuild their cities, i will destroy them again.” that is why people say edom is an evil country—a nation the lord hates forever.
you people saw these things, and you said, “the lord is great, even outside of israel!” 
the lord all-powerful said, “children honor their fathers.
servants honor their masters.
i am your father, so why don’t you honor me?
i am your master, so why don’t you respect me?
you priests don’t respect my name.
“but you say, ‘what have we done that shows we don’t respect your name?’ 
“you bring unclean bread to my altar.
“but you ask, ‘what makes that bread unclean?’ “it is unclean because you show no respect for the altar of the lord.
you bring blind animals as sacrifices, and that is wrong.
you bring sick and crippled animals for sacrifices, and that is wrong.
try giving those sick animals as a gift to your governor.
would he accept those sick animals?
no, he would not accept them.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“now try asking god to be good to you.
but he will not listen to you, and it is all your fault.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“i wish one of you would close the temple doors to stop the lighting of useless fires on my altar.
i am not pleased with you.
i will not accept your gifts.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“people all around the world respect my name.
all around the world they bring good gifts to me and burn good incense as a gift to me, because my name is important to all of them.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“but you people show that you don’t respect my name.
you say that the lord’s altar is unclean.
and you don’t like the food from that altar.
you smell the food and refuse to eat it.
you say it is bad.
then you bring sick, crippled, and hurt animals to me.
you try to give sick animals to me as sacrifices, but i will not accept them.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“some people have good, male animals that they could give as sacrifices, but don’t.
some people bring good animals and promise to give those healthy animals to me.
but then they secretly exchange those good animals and give me sick animals instead.
bad things will happen to those people.
i am the great king and people all around the world respect me!” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
chapter 60.
“jerusalem, get up and shine!
your light is coming!
the glory of the lord will shine on you.
darkness now covers the earth, and the people are in darkness.
but the lord will shine on you, and his glory will appear over you.
then the nations will come to your light.
kings will come to your bright sunrise.
look around you!
see all the people gathering around.
those are your sons coming from far away, and your daughters are there beside them.
“at that time you will see your people, and your faces will shine with happiness.
first, you will be afraid, but then you will be excited.
all the riches from across the seas will be set before you.
the riches of the nations will come to you.
herds of camels from midian and ephah will cross your land.
long lines of camels will come from sheba.
they will bring gold and incense.
people will sing praises to the lord.
people will collect all the sheep from kedar and give them to you.
they will bring you rams from nebaioth.
you will offer those animals on my altar, and i will accept them.
i will make my wonderful temple even more beautiful.
look at the people.
they are rushing toward you like clouds quickly crossing the sky.
they are like doves flying to their nests.
the faraway lands are waiting for me.
the great cargo ships are ready to sail.
they are ready to bring your children from faraway lands.
they will bring silver and gold with them to honor the lord your god, the holy one of israel.
he has done wonderful things for you.
children from other lands will rebuild your walls.
their kings will serve you.
“when i was angry, i hurt you, but now i want to be kind to you.
so i will comfort you.
your gates will always be open.
they will not be closed, day or night.
nations and kings will bring their wealth to you.
any nation or kingdom that does not serve you will be destroyed.
all the great things of lebanon will be given to you.
people will bring pine trees, fir trees, and cypress trees to you.
these trees will be used for lumber to make my holy place more beautiful.
this place is like a stool in front of my throne, and i will honor it.
in the past, people hurt you, but they will bow down before you.
in the past, people hated you, but they will bow down at your feet.
they will call you ‘the city of the lord’s,’ ‘zion of the holy one of israel.’ 
“people hated you.
you were left all alone with no one passing through.
but i will make you great from now on.
you will be happy forever and ever.
nations will give you what you need, like a child drinking milk from its mother.
but you will ‘drink’ riches from kings.
then you will know that it is i, the lord, who saves you.
you will know that i, the great god of jacob, protect you.
“you now have copper, but i will bring you gold.
you now have iron, but i will bring you silver.
i will change your wood into copper and your rocks into iron.
i will change your punishment into peace.
and those who punished you will be replaced with those who are kind to you.
there will never again be news of violence in your country.
people will never again attack your country and steal from you.
you will name your walls, ‘salvation’ and your gates, ‘praise.’ 
“the sun will no longer be your light during the day.
the light from the moon will no longer be your light at night.
the lord will be your light forever.
your god will be your glory.
your sun will never go down again.
your moon will never again be dark.
that’s because the lord will be your light forever, and the dark days of mourning will end.
“all your people will be good.
they will get the land forever.
they are the young plant in my garden that will grow to be a wonderful tree.
i made them with my own hands.
the smallest family will become a large family group.
the smallest tribe will become a powerful nation.
when the time is right, i, the lord, will come quickly.
i will make these things happen.” 
judges.
chapter 3.
the lord did not force all the other nations to leave israel’s land.
he wanted to test the israelites.
none of the israelites living at this time had fought in the wars to take the land of canaan.
so he let those other nations stay in their country.
(he did this to teach the israelites who had not fought in those wars.)
these are the nations the lord left in the land: 
the five rulers of the philistines, all the canaanites, the people of sidon, and the hivites who lived in the lebanon mountains from mount baal hermon to lebo hamath.
he left those nations in the land to test the israelites.
he wanted to see if the israelites would obey the lord’s commands that he had given to their ancestors through moses.
the israelites lived with the canaanites, hittites, the amorites, perizzites, hivites, and jebusites.
the israelites began to marry the daughters of those people.
they allowed their own daughters to marry the sons of those people.
the israelites also began to worship their gods.
the lord saw that the israelites did evil things.
they forgot about the lord their god and served the false gods baal and asherah.
the lord was angry with the israelites, so he allowed king cushan rishathaim of aram naharaim to defeat the israelites and to rule over them.
the israelites were under that king’s rule for eight years.
but the israelites cried to the lord for help, and the lord sent a man named othniel to save them.
he was the son of kenaz, who was caleb’s younger brother.
othniel saved the israelites.
the spirit of the lord filled othniel, and he became a judge for the israelites.
he led the israelites to war.
the lord helped othniel defeat king cushan rishathaim of aram.
so the land was at peace for 40 years, until othniel son of kenaz died.
again the israelites did things the lord considered evil, and the lord saw them doing these things.
so the lord gave king eglon of moab power to defeat the israelites.
eglon got help from the ammonites and the amalekites.
they joined him and attacked the israelites.
eglon and his army defeated the israelites and forced them to leave the city of palm trees.
king eglon of moab ruled over the israelites for 18 years.
the israelites cried to the lord for help, so he sent a man named ehud son of gera to save them.
ehud was from the tribe of benjamin and was trained to fight with his left hand.
the israelites sent ehud with a gift to king eglon of moab.
ehud made himself a sword with two sharp edges that was about 12 inches long.
he tied the sword to his right thigh and hid it under his uniform.
so ehud brought the gift to king eglon of moab.
eglon was a very fat man.
after offering the gift, ehud left the palace with the men who had carried the gift.
when ehud reached the statues near gilgal, he turned and went back to king eglon and said, “king, i have a secret message for you.” the king told him to be quiet and then sent all the servants out of the room.
ehud went to king eglon.
the king was sitting all alone in the upper room of his palace.
then ehud said, “i have a message from god for you.” the king stood up from his throne.
he was very close to ehud.
as the king was getting up from his throne, ehud reached with his left hand and took out the sword that was tied to his right thigh.
then he pushed the sword into the king’s belly.
the sword went into eglon’s belly so far that even the handle sank in and the fat closed around it.
the point of the blade came out his back.
ehud left the sword inside eglon.
then ehud went out of the private room, closed the doors to the upper room, and locked the king inside.
ehud then left the main room, and the servants went back in.
the servants found the doors to the upper room locked, so they said, “the king must be relieving himself in his private toilet.” 
the servants waited for a long time, but the king never opened the doors to the upper room.
finally, the servants got worried.
they got the key and unlocked the doors.
when the servants entered, they saw their king lying dead on the floor.
while the servants were waiting for the king, ehud had time to escape.
he passed by the statues and went toward the place named seirah.
when ehud came to seirah, he blew a trumpet there in the hill country of ephraim.
the israelites heard the trumpet and went down from the hills with ehud leading them.
he said to the israelites, “follow me!
the lord has helped us defeat our enemies, the moabites.” so the israelites followed ehud.
they went down with him to take control of the places where people could easily cross the jordan river into the land of moab.
the israelites did not allow any one to go across the jordan river.
they killed about 10,000 strong and brave men from moab.
not one moabite man escaped.
so on that day the israelites began to rule over the moabites, and there was peace in the land for 80 years.
after ehud saved the israelites, another man saved israel.
that man’s name was shamgar son of anath.
shamgar used an ox goad to kill 600 philistine men.
chapter 6.
in the year that king uzziah died, i saw the lord sitting on a very high and wonderful throne.
his long robe filled the temple.
seraph angels stood around him.
each angel had six wings.
they used two wings to cover their faces, two wings to cover their bodies, and two wings to fly.
the angels were calling to each other, “holy, holy, holy is the lord all-powerful.
his glory fills the whole earth.” 
the sound was so loud that it caused the frame around the door to shake, and the temple was filled with smoke.
i was frightened and said, “oh, no!
i will be destroyed.
i am not pure enough to speak to god, and i live among people who are not pure enough to speak to him.
but i have seen the king, the lord all-powerful.” 
there was a fire on the altar.
one of the seraph angels used a pair of tongs to take a hot coal from the fire.
then the angel flew to me with it in his hand.
then he touched my mouth with the hot coal and said, “when this hot coal touched your lips, your guilt was taken away, and your sins were erased.” 
then i heard the lord’s voice, saying, “who can i send?
who will go for us?” so i said, “here i am.
send me!” 
then the lord said, “go and tell the people, ‘listen closely, but don’t understand.
look closely, but don’t learn.’ 
confuse them.
make them unable to understand what they hear and see.
if you don’t do this, they might really look with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their minds.
then they might come back to me and be healed!” 
then i asked, “lord, how long should i do this?” he answered, “do this until the cities are destroyed and all the people are gone.
do this until there is no one left living in the houses and the land is destroyed and empty.” 
the lord will make the people go far away, and there will be large areas of empty land in the country.
a tenth of the people will be allowed to stay in the land, but it will be destroyed again.
they will be like an oak tree.
when the tree is chopped down, a stump is left.
this stump will be a very special seed that will grow again.
chapter 124.
a song of david for going up to the temple.
what would have happened to us if the lord had not been on our side?
tell us about it, israel.
what would have happened to us if the lord had not been on our side when people attacked us?
they would have swallowed us alive when they became angry with us.
their armies would have been like a flood washing over us, like a river drowning us.
those proud people would have been like water rising up to our mouth and drowning us.
praise the lord!
he did not let our enemies tear us apart.
we escaped like a bird from the net of a hunter.
the net broke, and we escaped!
our help came from the lord, the one who made heaven and earth!
chapter 37.
“the thunder and lightning frighten me; my heart pounds in my chest.
listen to god’s thundering voice!
listen to the sound coming from his mouth.
he sends his lightning to flash across the whole sky.
it lights up the earth from one end to the other.
after the flashes of lightning you can hear his roaring voice.
he thunders with his wonderful voice!
and while his voice thunders, the lightning flashes continue.
god’s thundering voice is amazing!
he does great things that we cannot understand.
he says to the snow, ‘fall on the earth.’ and he says to the rain, ‘pour down on the earth.’ 
god does this to stop everyone’s work and to show the people he made what he can do.
the animals run into their dens and stay there.
whirlwinds come from the south.
the cold winds come from the north.
god’s breath makes ice and freezes even large bodies of water.
he fills the clouds with water and scatters his lightning through them.
he orders the clouds to be blown all around the earth.
the clouds do whatever he commands.
he causes the clouds to punish people with floods or to water his earth and show his love.
“job, stop for a minute and listen.
think about the wonderful things god does.
do you know how god controls the clouds?
do you know how he makes his lightning flash?
do you know how the clouds hang in the sky?
this is just one of the amazing works of the one who knows everything.
all you know is that you sweat, your clothes stick to you, and all is still and quiet when the heat wave comes from the south.
can you help god spread out the sky and make it shine like polished brass?
“job, tell us what we should say to god!
we cannot think of what to say because of our ignorance.
i would not tell god that i wanted to talk to him.
that would be like asking to be destroyed.
a person cannot look at the sun.
it is too bright as it shines in the sky after the wind blows the clouds away.
in the same way god’s golden glory shines from the holy mountain.
he is surrounded by the brightest light.
we have seen that god all-powerful really is all powerful!
but he is just and never treats anyone unfairly.
that is why people fear and respect him.
he shows no respect for those who think they are wise.” 
genesis.
chapter 25.
abraham married again.
his new wife was named keturah.
she gave birth to zimran, jokshan, medan, midian, ishbak, and shuah.
jokshan was the father of sheba and dedan.
the people of asshur, leum, and letush were descendants of dedan.
the sons of midian were ephah, epher, hanoch, abida, and eldaah.
all these sons came from the marriage of abraham and keturah.
before abraham died, he gave some gifts to his sons who were from his slave women.
he sent them to the east, away from isaac.
then abraham gave everything he owned to isaac.
abraham lived to be 175 years old.
then he grew weak and died.
he had lived a long and satisfying life.
he died and went to be with his people.
his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah.
this cave is in the field of ephron, the son of zohar.
it was east of mamre.
this is the same cave that abraham bought from the hittites.
he was buried there with his wife sarah.
after abraham died, god blessed isaac.
isaac was living at beer lahai roi.
this is the list of ishmael’s family.
ishmael was abraham and hagar’s son.
(hagar was sarah’s egyptian maid.)
these are the names of ishmael’s sons: the first son was nebaioth; then kedar was born, then adbeel, mibsam, 
mishma, dumah, massa, 
hadad, tema, jetur, naphish, and kedemah.
these were the names of ishmael’s sons.
each son had his own camp that became a small town.
the twelve sons were leaders over their own people.
ishmael lived to be 137 years old.
then he died and went to be with his people.
his descendants settled throughout the desert area from havilah to shur.
this area begins near egypt and goes toward assyria.
ishmael’s people were often at war with the other descendants of abraham.
this is the story of isaac.
abraham had a son named isaac.
when isaac was 40 years old, he married rebekah.
rebekah was from paddan aram.
she was bethuel’s daughter and the sister of laban the aramean.
isaac’s wife could not have children.
so isaac prayed to the lord for her.
the lord heard isaac’s prayer, and he allowed rebekah to become pregnant.
while rebekah was pregnant, the babies inside her struggled with one another.
she prayed to the lord and said, “what is happening to me?” 
the lord said to her, “the leaders of two nations are in your body.
two nations will come from you, and they will be divided.
one of them will be stronger, and the older will serve the younger.” 
when the right time came, rebekah gave birth to twins.
the first baby was red.
his skin was like a hairy robe.
so he was named esau.
when the second baby was born, he was holding tightly to esau’s heel.
so that baby was named jacob.
isaac was 60 years old when jacob and esau were born.
the boys grew up.
esau became a skilled hunter, who loved to be out in the fields.
but jacob was a quiet man, who stayed at home.
isaac loved esau.
he liked to eat the animals esau killed.
but rebekah loved jacob.
one day esau came back from hunting.
he was tired and weak from hunger.
jacob was boiling a pot of beans.
so esau said to jacob, “i am weak with hunger.
let me have some of that red soup.” (that is why people call him “red.”) 
but jacob said, “you must sell me your rights as the firstborn son.” 
esau said, “i am almost dead with hunger, so what good are these rights to me now?” 
but jacob said, “first, promise me that you will give them to me.” so esau made an oath to him and sold his rights as the firstborn son to jacob.
then jacob gave esau bread and lentil soup.
esau ate the food, had something to drink, and then left.
so esau showed that he did not care about his rights as the firstborn son.
chapter 12.
these are the priests and levites who came back to the land of judah.
they came back with zerubbabel son of shealtiel and jeshua.
this is a list of their names: seraiah, jeremiah, ezra, 
amariah, malluch, hattush, 
shecaniah, rehum, meremoth, 
iddo, ginnethon, abijah, 
mijamin, maadiah, bilgah, 
shemaiah, joiarib, jedaiah, 
sallu, amok, hilkiah, and jedaiah.
these men were the leaders of the priests and their relatives in the days of jeshua.
the levites were jeshua, binnui, kadmiel, sherebiah, judah, and also mattaniah.
these men, with mattaniah’s relatives, were in charge of the songs of praise to god.
bakbukiah and unni were the relatives of those levites.
these two men stood across from them in the services.
jeshua was the father of joiakim.
joiakim was the father of eliashib.
eliashib was the father of joiada.
joiada was the father of jonathan, and jonathan was the father of jaddua.
in the days of joiakim, these men were the leaders of the families of priests: the leader of seraiah’s family was meraiah.
the leader of jeremiah’s family was hananiah.
the leader of ezra’s family was meshullam.
the leader of amariah’s family was jehohanan.
the leader of malluch’s family was jonathan.
the leader of shecaniah’s family was joseph.
the leader of harim’s family was adna.
the leader of meremoth’s family was helkai.
the leader of iddo’s family was zechariah.
the leader of ginnethon’s family was meshullam.
the leader of abijah’s family was zicri.
the leader of miniamin and maadiah’s families was piltai.
the leader of bilgah’s family was shammua.
the leader of shemaiah’s family was jehonathan.
the leader of joiarib’s family was mattenai.
the leader of jedaiah’s family was uzzi.
the leader of sallu’s family was kallai.
the leader of amok’s family was eber.
the leader of hilkiah’s family was hashabiah.
the leader of jedaiah’s family was nethanel.
the names of the leaders of the families of the levites and the priests in the days of eliashib, joiada, johanan, and jaddua were written down during the rule of darius the persian king.
the family leaders among the descendants of the levites and up to the time of johanan son of eliashib were written in the history book.
and these were the leaders of the levites: hashabiah, sherebiah, jeshua the son of kadmiel, and their brothers.
their brothers stood across from them to sing praise and honor to god.
one group answered the other group.
that is what was commanded by david the man of god.
the gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms next to the gates were mattaniah, bakbukiah, obadiah, meshullam, talmon, and akkub.
they served in the days of joiakim.
joiakim was the son of jeshua, who was the son of jozadak.
and the gatekeepers also served in the days of nehemiah the governor and in the days of ezra the priest and teacher.
the people dedicated the wall of jerusalem.
they brought all the levites to jerusalem.
the levites came from the towns they lived in.
they came to jerusalem to celebrate the dedication of the wall of jerusalem.
they came to sing songs of praise and thanks to god.
they played their cymbals, harps, and lyres.
and all the singers also came to jerusalem.
they came from the towns all around jerusalem.
they came from the town of netophah, from beth gilgal, geba, and azmaveth.
the singers had built small towns for themselves in the area around jerusalem.
so the priests and levites made themselves pure in a ceremony.
then they also made the people, the gates, and the wall of jerusalem pure in a ceremony.
i told the leaders of judah to go up and stand on top of the wall.
i also chose two large singing groups to give thanks to god.
one group was to start going up on top of the wall on the right side, toward the ash pile gate.
hoshaiah and half of the leaders of judah followed the singers.
also following them were azariah, ezra, meshullam, 
judah, benjamin, shemaiah, and jeremiah.
and some of the priests with trumpets also followed them up to the wall.
zechariah also followed them.
(zechariah was the son of jonathan, who was the son of shemaiah, who was the son of mattaniah, who was the son of micaiah, who was the son of zaccur, who was the son of asaph.)
there were also asaph’s brothers, who were shemaiah, azarel, milalai, gilalai, maai, nethanel, judah, and hanani.
they had the musical instruments that david, the man of god, had made.
ezra the teacher led the group of people who were there to dedicate the wall.
they went to the fountain gate and walked up the stairs all the way to the city of david.
they were on top of the city wall.
they walked over the house of david and went toward the water gate.
the second group of singers started out in the other direction, to the left.
i followed them as they went up to the top of the wall.
half of the people also followed them.
they went past the tower of ovens to the broad wall.
then they went over these gates: the gate of ephraim, the old gate, and the fish gate.
and they went over the tower of hananel and the tower of the hundred.
they went as far as the sheep gate and stopped at the guard gate.
then the two singing groups went to their places in god’s temple.
and i stood in my place.
and half the officials stood in their places in the temple.
then these priests stood in their places: eliakim, maaseiah, mijamin, micaiah, elioenai, zechariah, and hananiah.
these priests had their trumpets with them.
then these priests stood in their places in the temple: maaseiah, shemaiah, eleazar, uzzi, jehohanan, malkijah, elam, and ezer.
then two singing groups began singing with jezrahiah leading them.
so on that special day, the priests offered many sacrifices.
everyone was very happy because god had made them happy.
even the women and children were excited and happy.
people far away could hear the happy sounds coming from jerusalem.
men were chosen to be in charge of the storerooms on that day.
people brought the first part of the harvest and a tenth of their crops.
so the men in charge put these things in the storerooms.
the jewish people were very happy about the priests and levites on duty.
so they brought many things to be put in the storerooms.
the priests and levites did their work for their god.
they did the ceremonies that made people pure, and the singers and gatekeepers did their part.
they did everything that david and solomon had commanded.
(long ago, in the days of david, asaph had been the director.
and he had many songs of praise and thanks to god.)
so in the days of zerubbabel and of nehemiah, all the israelites gave every day to support the singers and gatekeepers.
the people also set aside the money for the other levites.
and the levites set aside the money for the descendants of aaron.
chapter 5.
so the lord dried up the jordan river until the israelites finished crossing it.
the kings of the amorites living west of the jordan river and the canaanites living by the mediterranean sea heard about this and became very frightened.
after that they were not brave enough to stand and fight against the israelites.
at that time the lord said to joshua, “make knives from flint rocks and circumcise the men of israel.” 
so joshua made knives from flint rocks and circumcised the men of israel at gibeath haaraloth.
this is why joshua circumcised the men: after the israelites left egypt, all the men who were able to serve in the army were circumcised.
while in the desert, many of the fighting men did not listen to the lord.
so the lord promised that they would not see the “land where much food grows.” he promised our ancestors to give us that land, but because of those men, he forced the people to wander in the desert for 40 years.
that way all those fighting men would die.
so all the fighting men died, and their sons took their place.
but none of the boys who were born in the desert on the trip from egypt had been circumcised.
so joshua circumcised them.
joshua finished circumcising all the men.
the people camped at that place until all the men were healed.
then the lord said to joshua, “you were slaves in egypt, and this made you ashamed.
but today i have taken away that shame.” so joshua named that place gilgal.
and that place is still named gilgal today.
the israelites celebrated passover while they were camped at gilgal on the plains of jericho.
this was on the evening of the 14th day of the month.
the day after passover, the people ate food that grew in that land.
they ate bread made without yeast and roasted grain.
the next morning, the manna from heaven stopped coming.
this happened the first day after the people ate the food that grew in the land of canaan.
from that time on, the israelites did not get the manna from heaven.
when joshua was near jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him.
the man had a sword in his hand.
joshua went to the man and asked, “are you a friend to our people or are you one of our enemies?” 
the man answered, “i am not an enemy.
i am the commander of the lord’s army.
i have just now come to you.” then joshua bowed his face to the ground to show respect and said, “i am your servant.
does my master have a command for me?” 
the commander of the lord’s army answered, “take off your sandals.
the place where you are standing is holy.” so joshua obeyed him.
chapter 86.
a prayer of david.
i am a poor, helpless man.
lord, please listen to me and answer my prayer!
i am your follower, so please protect me.
i am your servant, and you are my god.
i trust in you, so save me.
my lord, be kind to me.
i have been praying to you all day.
my lord, i put my life in your hands.
i am your servant, so make me happy.
my lord, you are good and merciful.
you love all those who call to you for help.
lord, hear my prayer.
listen to my cry for mercy.
i am praying to you in my time of trouble.
i know you will answer me.
my lord, there is no god like you.
no one can do what you have done.
my lord, you made everyone.
i wish they all would come worship you and honor your name.
you are great and do amazing things.
you and you alone are god.
lord, teach me your ways, and i will live and obey your truths.
help me make worshiping your name the most important thing in my life.
my lord god, i praise you with all my heart.
i will honor your name forever!
you have such great love for me.
you save me from the place of death.
proud people are attacking me, god.
a gang of cruel men is trying to kill me.
they don’t respect you.
my lord, you are a kind and merciful god.
you are patient, loyal, and full of love.
show that you hear me and be kind to me.
i am your servant, so give me strength.
i am your slave, as my mother was, so save me!
lord, show me a sign that you care for me.
my enemies will see it and be disappointed, because you helped and comforted me.
chapter 34.
moses climbed mount nebo.
moses went from the jordan valley in moab to the top of mount pisgah.
this was across the jordan river from jericho.
the lord showed moses all the land from gilead to dan.
he showed him all the land of naphtali, ephraim, and manasseh.
he showed him all the land of judah as far as the mediterranean sea.
he showed moses the negev and the valley that goes from zoar to jericho, the city of palm trees.
the lord said to moses, “this is the land i promised to abraham, isaac, and jacob.
i said to them, ‘i will give this land to your descendants.
i have let you see the land, but you cannot go there.’” 
then moses, the lord’s servant, died there in the land of moab.
the lord had told moses this would happen.
he buried moses in moab.
this was in the valley across from beth peor.
but even today, no one knows exactly where moses’ grave is.
moses was 120 years old when he died.
he was as strong as ever, and his eyes were still good.
the israelites cried for moses for 30 days.
they stayed in the jordan valley in moab until the time of sadness was finished.
moses had put his hands on joshua and appointed him to be the new leader.
then joshua son of nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom.
so the israelites began to obey joshua, and they did what the lord had commanded moses.
israel never had another prophet like moses: the lord knew moses face to face.
the lord sent moses to do powerful miracles in the land of egypt.
pharaoh, all his officers, and all the people in egypt saw those miracles.
no other prophet ever did as many powerful and amazing things as moses did for the israelites to see.
chapter 29.
on the twelfth day of the tenth month of the tenth year of exile, the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, look toward pharaoh, king of egypt.
speak for me against him and egypt.
say, ‘this is what the lord god says: “‘i am against you, pharaoh, king of egypt.
you are the great monster lying beside the nile river.
you say, “this is my river!
i made this river!” 
“‘but i will put hooks in your jaws.
the fish in the nile river will stick to your scales.
i will pull you and your fish up out of your rivers and onto the dry land.
you will fall on the ground, and no one will pick you up or bury you.
i will give you to the wild animals and birds.
you will be their food.
then all the people living in egypt will know that i am the lord!
“‘why will i do these things?
because the people of israel leaned on egypt for support, but egypt was only a weak blade of grass.
the people of israel leaned on egypt for support, but egypt only pierced their hands and shoulder.
they leaned on you for support, but you broke and twisted their back.’” 
so this is what the lord god says: “i will bring a sword against you.
i will destroy all your people and animals.
egypt will be empty and destroyed.
then they will know that i am the lord.” god said, “why will i do these things?
because you said, ‘this is my river.
i made this river.’ 
so i am against you.
i am against the many branches of your nile river.
i will destroy egypt completely.
the cities will be empty from migdol to aswan and as far as the border of ethiopia.
no person or animal will pass through egypt.
nothing will pass through or settle there for 40 years.
i will destroy egypt.
the cities will be in ruins for 40 years!
i will scatter the egyptians among the nations.
i will make them strangers in foreign lands.” 
this is what the lord god says: “i will scatter the people of egypt among many nations.
but at the end of 40 years, i will gather those people together again.
i will bring back the egyptian captives.
i will bring back the egyptians to the land of pathros, to the land where they were born.
but their kingdom will not be important.
it will be the least important kingdom.
it will never again lift itself above the other nations.
i will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.
and the family of israel will never again depend on egypt.
the israelites will remember their sin—they will remember that they turned to egypt for help and not to god, and they will know that i am the lord god.” 
on the first day of the first month in the twenty-seventh year of exile, the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, king nebuchadnezzar of babylon made his army fight hard against tyre.
they shaved every soldier’s head.
every shoulder was rubbed bare from carrying heavy loads.
nebuchadnezzar and his army worked hard to defeat tyre, but they got nothing from all that hard work.” 
so this is what the lord god says: “i will give egypt to king nebuchadnezzar of babylon, and he will carry away the people.
he will take the many valuable things in egypt to pay his army.
i will give egypt to nebuchadnezzar as a reward for the hard work he did for me.” this is what the lord god said!
“on that day i will make the family of israel strong.
so ezekiel, i will let you speak to them.
then they will know that i am the lord.” 
1 samuel.
chapter 15.
one day samuel said to saul, “the lord sent me to anoint you king over his people israel.
now listen to his message.
the lord all-powerful says: ‘when the israelites came out of egypt, the amalekites tried to stop them from going to canaan.
i saw what the amalekites did.
now go fight against the amalekites.
you must completely destroy the amalekites and everything that belongs to them.
don’t let anything live; you must kill all the men and women and all of their children and little babies.
you must kill all of their cattle and sheep and all of their camels and donkeys.’” 
saul gathered the army together at telaim.
there were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 other men, including the men from judah.
then saul went to the city of amalek and waited in the valley.
he said to the kenites, “go away!
leave the amalekites.
then i won’t destroy you with the amalekites.
you showed kindness to the israelites when they came out of egypt.” so the kenites left the amalekites.
saul defeated the amalekites.
he fought them and chased them all the way from havilah to shur, at the border of egypt.
agag was the king of the amalekites.
saul captured agag alive.
saul let agag live, but he killed all the men in agag’s army.
saul and the israelite soldiers felt bad about destroying everything.
so they let agag live.
they also kept the fat cattle, the best sheep, and the lambs.
they kept everything that was worth keeping.
they didn’t want to destroy those things.
they destroyed only what was not worth keeping.
then samuel received this message from the lord: 
“saul has stopped following me, so i am sorry that i made him king.
he is not doing what i tell him.” samuel became angry and cried to the lord all night.
samuel got up early the next morning and went to meet saul.
but the people told samuel, “saul went to carmel.
he went there to set up a stone monument to honor himself.
then he left there and went down to gilgal.” so samuel went to saul.
saul had just offered the first part of the things he took from the amalekites as a burnt offering to the lord.
when samuel came near to saul, saul greeted him and said, “the lord bless you!
i have obeyed the lord’s commands.” 
but samuel said, “then what is that sound i hear?
why do i hear sheep and cattle?” 
saul said, “the soldiers took them from the amalekites.
they saved the best sheep and cattle to burn as sacrifices to the lord your god.
but we destroyed everything else.” 
samuel said to saul, “stop!
let me tell you what the lord told me last night.” saul answered, “tell me what he said.” 
samuel said, “in the past you didn’t think that you were important, but the lord chose you to be the king.
so you became the leader of the tribes of israel.
the lord sent you on a special mission.
he said, ‘go and destroy all the amalekites.
they are evil people.
destroy them all!
fight them until they are completely finished.’ 
so why didn’t you listen to the lord?
you did what the lord said is wrong because you wanted to keep what you took in battle.” 
saul said, “but i did obey the lord!
i went where the lord sent me.
i destroyed all the amalekites.
i brought back only one—their king agag.
and the soldiers took the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the lord your god at gilgal.” 
but samuel answered, “which pleases the lord more: burnt offerings and sacrifices or obeying his commands?
it is better to obey the lord than to offer sacrifices to him.
it is better to listen to him than to offer the fat from rams.
refusing to obey is as bad as the sin of sorcery.
being stubborn and doing what you want is like the sin of worshiping idols.
you refused to obey the lord’s command, so he now refuses to accept you as king.” 
then saul said to samuel, “i have sinned.
i did not obey the lord’s commands, and i did not do what you told me.
i was afraid of the people, and i did what they said.
now i beg you, forgive me for doing this sin.
come back with me, so i may worship the lord.” 
but samuel said to saul, “i won’t go back with you.
you rejected the lord’s command, and now the lord rejects you as king of israel.” 
when samuel turned to leave, saul caught samuel’s robe.
the robe tore.
samuel said to saul, “in this same way the lord has torn the kingdom of israel from you today.
he has given the kingdom to one of your friends, a man who is a better person than you.
the one who lives forever, the god of israel, does not lie and will not change his mind.
he is not like a man who is always changing his mind.” 
saul answered, “all right, i sinned!
but please come back with me.
show me some respect in front of the leaders and the israelites.
come back with me so that i may worship the lord your god.” 
samuel went back with saul, and saul worshiped the lord.
samuel said, “bring king agag of the amalekites to me.” agag came to samuel.
agag was tied with chains and thought, “surely he won’t kill me.” 
but samuel said to agag, “your sword took babies from their mothers.
so now, your mother will have no children.” and samuel cut agag to pieces before the lord at gilgal.
then samuel left and went to ramah.
and saul went up to his home in gibeah.
after that samuel never saw saul again.
samuel was very sad for saul.
and the lord was very sorry that he had made saul king of israel.
chapter 65.
