the people in the city were afraid because the israelites were near.
no one went into the city, and no one came out.
then the lord said to joshua, “look, i will let you defeat the city of jericho.
you will defeat the king and all the fighting men in the city.
march around the city with your army once every day for six days.
tell seven of the priests to carry trumpets made from the horns of male sheep and to march in front of the priests who are carrying the holy box.
on the seventh day march around the city seven times and tell the priests to blow the trumpets while they march.
they will make one loud noise from the trumpets.
when you hear that noise, tell all the people to begin shouting.
when you do this, the walls of the city will fall down and your people will be able to go straight into the city.” 
so joshua son of nun called the priests together and said to them, “carry the holy box of the lord.
tell seven priests to carry the trumpets and march in front of it.” 
then joshua ordered the people, “now go!
march around the city.
the soldiers with weapons will march in front of the holy box of the lord.” 
after joshua finished speaking to the people, the seven priests with the trumpets began marching before the lord, blowing the trumpets as they marched.
the priests carrying the lord’s holy box followed them.
the soldiers with weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing the horns.
and the rest of the men walked behind the holy box, marching and blowing their trumpets.
joshua had told the people not to give a war cry.
he said, “don’t shout.
don’t say a word until the day i tell you.
then you will shout.” 
so joshua made the priests carry the holy box of the lord around the city one time.
then they went back to the camp and spent the night there.
early the next morning joshua got up, and the priests carried the lord’s holy box again.
the seven priests with the trumpets marched in front of the lord’s holy box, blowing their trumpets.
the soldiers with weapons marched in front of them.
the rest of the people marched behind the lord’s holy box.
during the whole time they marched, the priests were blowing the trumpets.
on the second day, they all marched around the city one time.
and then they went back to the camp.
they continued to do this every day for six days.
on the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times.
they marched in the same way they had marched on the days before, but on that day they marched around the city seven times.
the seventh time they marched around the city, the priests blew their trumpets.
then joshua gave the command: “now, shout!
the lord is giving you this city!
the city and everything is to be destroyed as an offering to the lord.
only rahab the prostitute and everyone in her house will be left alive.
these people must not be killed because she helped the two spies.
remember, we must destroy everything else.
don’t take anything.
if you take anything and bring it into our camp, you yourselves will be destroyed, and you will cause trouble for the rest of our people.
all the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron belong to the lord.
they must be put in the lord’s treasury.” 
so then the priests blew the trumpets.
when the people heard the trumpets, they began shouting.
the walls fell down, and the people ran up into the city.
so the israelites defeated that city.
the people destroyed everything in the city.
they destroyed everything that was living there.
they killed the young and old men, the young and old women, and the cattle, sheep, and donkeys.
joshua talked to the two spies.
he said, “you made a promise to the prostitute.
so go to her house and bring her out and all those who are with her.” 
so the two men went into the house and brought out rahab, her father, mother, brothers, all her family, and all those who were with her.
they put all the people in a safe place outside the camp of israel.
then the israelites burned the whole city and everything in it except for the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron.
they put these things in the lord’s treasury.
joshua saved rahab the prostitute, her family, and all those who were with her.
joshua let them live because rahab helped the spies joshua had sent out to jericho.
rahab still lives among the israelites today.
at that time joshua made this important promise.
he said, “whoever rebuilds jericho will be in danger from the lord.
when he lays the foundation, he will lose his oldest son.
when he sets up the gates, he will lose his youngest son.” 
so the lord was with joshua, and joshua became famous throughout the whole country.
chapter 14.
that night all the people in the camp began shouting loudly.
the israelites complained against moses and aaron.
all the people came together and said to moses and aaron, “we should have died in egypt or in the desert.
did the lord bring us to this new land to be killed in war?
the enemy will kill us and take our wives and children!
it would be better for us to go back to egypt.” 
then the people said to each other, “let’s choose another leader and go back to egypt.” 
moses and aaron bowed low to the ground in front of all the people gathered there.
joshua and caleb became very upset.
(joshua son of nun and caleb son of jephunneh were two of the men who explored the land.)
these two men said to all the israelites gathered there, “the land that we saw is very good.
it is a land filled with many good things.
if the lord is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land.
and he will give that land to us.
so don’t turn against the lord!
don’t be afraid of the people in that land.
we can defeat them.
they have no protection, nothing to keep them safe.
but we have the lord with us, so don’t be afraid!” 
all the people began talking about killing joshua and caleb with stones.
but the glory of the lord appeared over the meeting tent where all the people could see it.
the lord spoke to moses and said, “how long will these people continue to turn against me?
they show that they don’t trust me or believe in my power, in spite of the many miracles i have done among them.
i will kill them all with a terrible sickness.
i will destroy them, and i will use you to make another nation.
your nation will be greater and stronger than these people.” 
then moses said to the lord, “if you do that, the egyptians will hear about it!
they know that you used your great power to bring your people out of egypt.
the egyptians have already told the people in canaan about it.
they already know you are the lord.
they know that you are with your people.
they know that the people saw you.
those people know about the special cloud.
they know you use the cloud to lead your people during the day.
and they know the cloud becomes a fire to lead your people at night.
so you must not kill these people now.
if you kill them, all the nations who have heard about your power will say, 
‘the lord was not able to bring them into the land he promised them.
so he killed them in the desert.’ 
“so now, lord, show your strength!
show it the way you said you would.
you said, ‘the lord is slow to become angry.
he is full of great love.
he forgives those who are guilty and break the law.
but he always punishes those who are guilty.
he punishes them, and he also punishes their children, their grandchildren, and even their great-grandchildren for those bad things.’ 
now, show your great love to these people.
forgive their sin.
forgive them the same way you have been forgiving them since the time they left egypt until now.” 
the lord answered, “yes, i will forgive the people as you asked.
but i tell you the truth.
as surely as i live and as surely as the glory of the lord fills the whole earth, i make you this promise: 
none of the people i led out of egypt will ever see the land of canaan.
they saw my glory and the great signs that i did in egypt and in the desert.
but they disobeyed me and tested me ten times.
i promised their ancestors that i would give them that land.
but none of those people who turned against me will ever enter that land!
but my servant caleb was different.
he follows me completely.
so i will bring him into the land that he has already seen, and his people will get that land.
the amalekites and the canaanites are living in the valley.
so tomorrow you must leave this place.
go back to the desert on the road to the red sea.” 
the lord said to moses and aaron, 
“how long will these evil people continue to complain against me?
i have heard their complaints and their griping.
so tell them, ‘the lord says that he will surely do all those things to you that you complained about.
this is what will happen to you: 
you will die in this desert.
every person who is 20 years old or older and was counted as one of my people will die.
you complained against me.
so none of you will ever enter and live in the land that i promised to give you.
only caleb son of jephunneh and joshua son of nun will enter that land.
you were afraid and complained that your enemies in that new land would take your children away from you.
but i tell you that i will bring them into the land.
they will enjoy what you refused to accept.
as for you people, you will die in this desert.
“‘your children will wander around like shepherds here in the desert for 40 years.
they will suffer because you were not faithful to me.
they must suffer until all of you lie dead in the desert.
for 40 years you will suffer for your sins.
(that is one year for each of the 40 days that the men explored the land.)
you will know that it is a terrible thing for me to be against you.’ 
“i am the lord, and i have spoken.
and i promise that i will do these things to all these evil people.
they have come together against me.
so they will all die here in this desert.” 
the men moses sent to explore the new land were the ones who came back complaining about him to all the israelites.
they said that the people were not strong enough to enter that land.
the men were responsible for spreading the trouble among the israelites.
so the lord caused a sickness to kill all those men.
but joshua son of nun and caleb son of jephunneh were among the men who were sent out to explore the land.
they are the only ones who did not get the sickness that caused the others to die.
when moses told the israelites this, they were very sad.
early the next morning the people started to go up to the high hill country.
they said, “we have sinned.
we are sorry that we did not trust the lord.
we will go to the place that the lord promised.” 
but moses said, “why are you not obeying the lord’s command?
you will not be successful!
don’t go into that land.
the lord is not with you, so your enemies will easily defeat you.
the amalekites and canaanites will fight against you there.
you have turned away from the lord, so he will not be with you when you fight them.
and you will all be killed in battle.” 
but the people did not believe moses.
they went toward the high hill country.
but moses and the box of the lord’s agreement did not go with the people.
the amalekites and the canaanites living in the hill country came down and attacked the israelites and easily defeated them and chased them all the way to hormah.
chapter 7.
my son, remember my words.
don’t forget what i have told you.
consider my teaching as precious as your own eyes.
obey my commands, and you will have a good life.
tie them around your finger.
write them on your heart.
treat wisdom like the woman you love and knowledge like the one dearest to you.
wisdom will save you from that other woman, the other man’s wife, who tempts you with such sweet words.
one day i was looking out my window 
at some foolish teenagers and noticed one who had no sense at all.
he was walking through the marketplace and came to the corner where a certain woman lived.
he then turned up the road that goes by her house.
the day was ending.
the sun had set, and it was almost dark.
suddenly, there she was in front of him, dressed like a prostitute.
she had plans for him.
she was a wild and rebellious woman who would not stay at home.
she walked the streets, always looking for someone to trap.
she grabbed the young man and kissed him.
without shame, she looked him in the eye and said, 
“i offered a fellowship offering today.
i gave what i promised to give, 
and i still have plenty of food left.
so i came out to find you, and here you are!
i have clean sheets on my bed—special ones from egypt.
my bed smells wonderful with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
come, let’s enjoy ourselves all night.
we can make love until dawn.
my husband has gone on a business trip.
he took enough money for a long trip and won’t be home for two weeks.” 
this is what the woman said to tempt the young man, and her smooth words tricked him.
he followed her, like a bull being led to the slaughter.
he was like a deer walking into a trap, 
where a hunter waits to shoot an arrow through its heart.
the boy was like a bird flying into a net, never seeing the danger he was in.
now, sons, listen to me.
pay attention to what i say.
don’t let your heart lead you to an evil woman like that.
don’t go where she wants to lead you.
she has brought down some of the most powerful men; she has left many dead bodies in her path.
her house is the place of death.
the road to it leads straight to the grave.
chapter 91.
you can go to god most high to hide.
you can go to god all-powerful for protection.
i say to the lord, “you are my place of safety, my fortress.
my god, i trust in you.” 
god will save you from hidden dangers and from deadly diseases.
you can go to him for protection.
he will cover you like a bird spreading its wings over its babies.
you can trust him to surround and protect you like a shield.
you will have nothing to fear at night and no need to be afraid of enemy arrows during the day.
you will have no fear of diseases that come in the dark or terrible suffering that comes at noon.
a thousand people may fall dead at your side or ten thousand right beside you, but nothing bad will happen to you!
all you will have to do is watch, and you will see that the wicked are punished.
you trust in the lord for protection.
you have made god most high your place of safety.
so nothing bad will happen to you.
no diseases will come near your home.
he will command his angels to protect you wherever you go.
their hands will catch you so that you will not hit your foot on a rock.
you will have power to trample on lions and poisonous snakes.
the lord says, “if someone trusts me, i will save them.
i will protect my followers who call to me for help.
when my followers call to me, i will answer them.
i will be with them when they are in trouble.
i will rescue them and honor them.
i will give my followers a long life and show them my power to save.” 
exodus.
chapter 18.
jethro, moses’ father-in-law, was a priest in midian.
he heard about the many ways that god helped moses and the israelites.
he heard about the lord leading the israelites out of egypt.
so jethro went to moses while moses was camped near the mountain of god.
jethro brought moses’ wife, zipporah, with him.
(zipporah was not with moses, because moses had sent her home.)
jethro also brought moses’ two sons with him.
the first son was named gershom, because when he was born, moses said, “i am a stranger in a foreign country.” 
the other son was named eliezer, because when he was born, moses said, “the god of my father helped me and saved me from the king of egypt.” 
so jethro went to moses while moses was camped in the desert near the mountain of god.
moses’ wife and his two sons were with jethro.
jethro sent a message to moses that said, “this is your father-in-law jethro.
i am bringing your wife and her two sons to you.” 
so moses went out to meet his father-in-law.
moses bowed down before him and kissed him.
the two men asked about each other’s health.
then they went into moses’ tent to talk more.
moses told jethro everything the lord had done for the israelites.
he told what the lord did to pharaoh and the people of egypt.
he told about all the problems they had along the way.
and he told his father-in-law how the lord saved the israelites every time there was trouble.
jethro was happy when he heard all the good things the lord had done for israel.
he was glad that the lord had freed the israelites from the egyptians.
he said, “praise the lord!
he freed you from the power of egypt.
he saved you from pharaoh.
now i know the lord is greater than all the gods.
they thought they were in control, but look what god did!” 
jethro got some sacrifices and offerings to honor god.
then aaron and all the elders of israel came to eat with moses’ father-in-law jethro.
they all ate together there with god.
the next day, moses had the special job of judging the people.
there were so many people that they had to stand before him all day.
jethro saw moses judging the people.
he asked, “why are you doing this?
why are you the only judge?
and why do people come to you all day?” 
then moses said to his father-in-law, “the people come to me and ask me to ask for god’s decision for their problem.
if people have an argument, they come to me, and i decide which person is right.
in this way i teach the people god’s laws and teachings.” 
but moses’ father-in-law said to him, “this isn’t the right way to do this.
it is too much work for you to do alone.
you cannot do this job by yourself.
it wears you out.
and it makes the people tired too.
now, listen to me.
let me give you some advice.
and i pray god will be with you.
you should continue listening to the problems of the people.
and you should continue to speak to god about these things.
you should explain god’s laws and teachings to the people.
warn them not to break the laws.
tell them the right way to live and what they should do.
but you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders.
“choose good men you can trust—men who respect god.
choose men who will not change their decisions for money.
make these men rulers over the people.
there should be rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and even over ten people.
let these rulers judge the people.
if there is a very important case, then they can come to you and let you decide what to do.
but they can decide the other cases themselves.
in this way these men will share your work with you, and it will be easier for you to lead the people.
if you do this as god directs you, then you will be able to do your job without tiring yourself out.
and the people can still have all their problems solved before they return home.” 
so moses did what jethro told him.
moses chose good men from among the israelites.
he made them leaders over the people.
there were rulers over 1000 people, 100 people, 50 people, and ten people.
these rulers were judges for the people.
the people could always bring their arguments to these rulers, and moses had to decide only the most important cases.
after a short time moses said goodbye to his father-in-law jethro, and jethro went back to his own home.
1 chronicles.
chapter 17.
after david had moved into his palace, he said to nathan the prophet, “look, i am living in this nice palace made of cedar, but the box of the lord’s agreement sits in a tent.” 
nathan answered david, “you may do what you want to do.
god is with you.” 
but that night the word of god came to nathan.
god said, “go and tell this to my servant david: the lord says, ‘david, you are not the one to build a house for me to live in.
since the time i brought israel out of egypt until now, i have not lived in a house.
i have moved around in a tent.
i chose people to be special leaders for the israelites.
they were like shepherds for my people.
while i was going around in israel to different places, i never said to any of them: why haven’t you built a house of cedar wood for me?’ 
“now, tell this to my servant david: the lord all-powerful says, ‘i took you from the fields and from taking care of the sheep.
i made you king of my people israel.
i have been with you everywhere you went.
i went ahead of you and i killed your enemies.
now i will make you one of the most famous men on earth.
i am giving this place to my people israel.
they will plant their trees, and they will sit in peace under those trees.
they will not be bothered anymore.
evil people will not hurt them as they did at first.
those bad things happened, but i chose leaders to care for my people israel.
and i will also defeat all your enemies.
“‘i tell you that the lord will build a house for you.
when you die, and you join your ancestors, then i will let your own son be the new king.
the new king will be one of your sons, and i will make his kingdom strong.
your son will build a house for me.
i will make your son’s family rule forever.
i will be his father, and he will be my son.
saul was the king before you, and i took away my support from saul.
but i will never stop loving your son.
i will put him in charge of my house and kingdom forever.
his rule will continue forever!’” 
nathan told david about the vision and everything god had said.
then king david went to the holy tent and sat before the lord.
david said, “lord god, you have done so much for me and my family.
and i don’t understand why.
besides all these things, god, you let me know what will happen to my family in the future.
lord god, you have treated me like a very important man.
what more can i say?
you have done so much for me.
and i am only your servant.
you know that.
lord, you have done this wonderful thing for me and because you wanted to.
there is no one like you, lord.
there is no god except you.
we have never heard of any god doing wonderful things like those!
is there any other nation like israel?
no, israel is the only nation on earth that you have done these wonderful things for.
you took us out of egypt and you made us free.
you made yourself famous.
you went in front of your people, and forced other people to leave their land for us.
you took israel to be your people forever, and you, lord, became their god!
“lord, you made this promise to me and my family.
now, keep your promise forever.
do what you said you would.
keep your promise so that people will honor your name forever.
then people will say, ‘the lord all-powerful is israel’s god!’ i am your servant.
please let my family be strong and continue to serve you.
“my god, you spoke to me, your servant.
you made it clear that you would make my family a family of kings.
that is why i am being so bold—that is why i am asking you to do these things.
lord, you are god, and you yourself promised to do these good things for me.
you have been kind enough to bless my family.
you were kind enough to promise that my family will serve you forever.
lord, you yourself blessed my family, so my family really will be blessed forever.” 
exodus.
chapter 10.
the lord said to moses, “go to pharaoh.
i have made him and his officials stubborn.
i did this so that i could show them my powerful miracles.
i also did this so that you could tell your children and your grandchildren about the miracles and other wonderful things that i have done in egypt.
then all of you will know that i am the lord.” 
so moses and aaron went to pharaoh.
they told him, “the lord, the god of the hebrews, says, ‘how long will you refuse to obey me?
let my people go to worship me!
if you refuse to let my people go, then tomorrow i will bring locusts into your country.
the locusts will cover the land.
there will be so many locusts that you will not be able to see the ground.
anything that was left from the hailstorm will be eaten by the locusts.
the locusts will eat all the leaves from every tree in the field.
they will fill all your houses, and all your officials’ houses, and all the houses in egypt.
there will be more locusts than your fathers or your grandfathers have ever seen.
there will be more locusts than there have ever been since people began living in egypt.’” then moses turned and left pharaoh.
then the officials asked pharaoh, “how long will we be trapped by these people?
let the men go to worship the lord their god.
if you don’t let them go, before you know it, egypt will be destroyed!” 
so pharaoh told his officials to bring moses and aaron back to him.
pharaoh said to them, “go and worship the lord your god.
but tell me, just who is going?” 
moses answered, “all of our people, young and old, will go.
and we will take our sons and daughters, and our sheep and cattle with us.
we will all go because the lord’s festival is for all of us.” 
pharaoh said to them, “the lord really will have to be with you before i let you and all of your children leave egypt.
look, you are planning something evil.
the men can go worship the lord.
that is what you asked for in the beginning.
but all of your people cannot go.” then pharaoh sent moses and aaron away.
the lord told moses, “raise your hand over the land of egypt and the locusts will come!
they will spread all over the land of egypt and will eat all the plants that the hail did not destroy.” 
so moses raised his walking stick over the land of egypt, and the lord caused a strong wind to blow from the east.
the wind blew all that day and night.
when morning came, the wind had brought the locusts to the land of egypt.
the locusts flew into the country of egypt and landed on the ground.
there were more locusts than there had ever been in egypt.
and there will never again be that many locusts there.
they covered the ground, and the whole country became dark.
the locusts ate every plant on the ground and all the fruit in the trees that the hail had not destroyed.
there were no leaves left on any of the trees or plants anywhere in egypt.
pharaoh quickly called for moses and aaron.
pharaoh said, “i have sinned against the lord your god and against you.
now, forgive me for my sins this time.
ask the lord to remove this ‘death’ from me.” 
moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord.
so the lord changed the wind.
he made a very strong wind blow from the west, and it blew the locusts out of egypt and into the red sea.
not one locust was left in egypt!
but the lord caused pharaoh to be stubborn again, and pharaoh did not let the israelites go.
then the lord told moses, “raise your hand into the air and darkness will cover egypt.
it will be so dark you can feel it!” 
so moses raised his hand into the air and a cloud of darkness covered egypt.
the darkness stayed in egypt for three days.
none of the people could see each other, and no one got up to go any place for three days.
but there was light in all the places where the israelites lived.
again pharaoh called for moses.
he said, “go and worship the lord!
you can take your children with you.
but you must leave your sheep and cattle here.” 
moses said, “no, we will take them all.
in fact, you will give us offerings and sacrifices for us to use in worshiping the lord our god.
yes, we will take our animals with us to worship the lord our god.
not one hoof will be left behind.
we don’t know yet exactly what we will need to worship the lord.
we will learn that only when we get there.” 
the lord made pharaoh stubborn again, so he refused to let them go.
then pharaoh told moses, “get out of here.
i don’t want you to come here again.
the next time you come to see me, you will die!” 
then moses told pharaoh, “you are right about one thing.
i will not come to see you again.” 
2 kings.
chapter 11.
athaliah was ahaziah’s mother.
she saw that her son was dead, so she got up and killed all the king’s family.
jehosheba was king joram’s daughter and ahaziah’s sister.
joash was one of the king’s sons.
while the other children were being killed, jehosheba took joash and hid him.
she put him and his nurse in her bedroom, so jehosheba and the nurse hid joash from athaliah.
that way joash was not killed.
then joash and jehosheba hid in the lord’s temple.
joash hid there for six years.
during that time athaliah ruled over the land of judah.
in the seventh year jehoiada the high priest sent for the captains of the carites and guards.
he brought them together in the lord’s temple and made an agreement with them.
there in the temple of the lord he forced them to make a promise.
then he showed the king’s son to them.
then jehoiada gave them a command.
he said, “this is what you must do.
one-third of you, from those who go on duty on the sabbath day, must stand guard at the royal palace.
another third will be at the sur gate, and the other third will be at the gate behind the guard.
this way you will stand guard over the palace on all sides.
your two divisions who go off duty on the sabbath day will stand guard at the lord’s temple and protect king joash.
you must stay with him wherever he goes.
the whole group must surround the king.
each guard must have his weapon in his hand, and you must kill anyone who comes too close to you.” 
the captains obeyed everything that jehoiada the priest commanded.
each captain took his men, both those who were going on duty on the sabbath day and those who were going off duty.
all these men went to jehoiada the priest, 
and he gave spears and shields to the captains.
these were the spears and shields david put in the lord’s temple.
these guards stood with their weapons in their hands from the right corner of the temple to the left corner.
they stood around the altar and the temple and around the king when he went to the temple.
these men brought out joash.
they put the crown on him and gave him a copy of the agreement.
then they anointed him and made him the new king.
they clapped their hands and shouted, “long live the king!” 
queen athaliah heard the noise from the guards and the people, so she went to them at the lord’s temple.
athaliah saw the king by the column where new kings usually stood.
she also saw the leaders and men playing the trumpets for him.
she saw that all the people were very happy.
she heard the trumpets, and she tore her clothes to show she was upset.
then athaliah shouted, “treason!
treason!” 
jehoiada the priest gave a command to the captains who were in charge of the soldiers.
jehoiada told them, “take athaliah outside of the temple area.
kill any of her followers, but don’t kill them in the lord’s temple.” 
so the soldiers grabbed athaliah and killed her as soon as she went through the horse’s entrance to the palace.
then jehoiada made the agreement between the lord and the king and the people.
this agreement showed that the king and the people belonged to the lord.
jehoiada also made the agreement between the king and the people.
then all the people went to the temple of baal.
they destroyed the statue of baal and his altars.
they broke them into many pieces.
they also killed baal’s priest, mattan, in front of the altars.
so jehoiada the priest put men in charge of maintaining the lord’s temple.
the priest led all the people.
they went from the lord’s temple to the king’s palace.
the king’s special guards and the captains went with the king, and all the other people followed them.
they went to the entrance to the king’s palace.
then king joash sat on the throne.
all the people were happy, and the city was peaceful.
and queen athaliah was killed with a sword near the king’s palace.
joash was seven years old when he became king.
2 chronicles.
chapter 5.
when all the work was completed on the lord’s temple, solomon brought in everything his father david had set aside for the temple.
solomon put all the furniture and all the things made of silver and gold into the storage rooms in god’s temple.
solomon commanded the elders of israel, the leaders of the tribes, and the heads of families to meet together in jerusalem.
he did this so that they could bring the box of the lord’s agreement up to the temple from the city of david, that is, zion.
all the men of israel met together before king solomon during the special festival in the seventh month of the year.
when all the elders of israel arrived, the levites lifted the box of the agreement 
and carried it up to the temple.
the priests and the levites also brought the meeting tent and all the holy things that were in it to the temple in jerusalem.
then king solomon and all the israelites met in front of the box of the agreement to offer sheep and bulls as sacrifices.
there were so many offerings that no one could count them.
then the priests carried the box of the lord’s agreement to the place that was prepared for it in the most holy place inside the temple.
they put the box of the agreement under the wings of the cherub angels.
the cherub angels stood with their wings spread over the box of the agreement and the poles that were used to carry it.
the poles are still there today.
they were too long for the most holy place, so their ends could be seen by anyone standing in the holy place, although no one outside could see them.
the only things inside the holy box are the two tablets that moses put there at matthew horeb.
this is where the lord made his agreement with the israelites after they came out of egypt.
all the priests who were there did the ceremony to make themselves holy.
then, as they came out of the holy place, they stood together, but not in their special groups.
the levite singers stood at the east side of the altar.
all the singing groups of asaph, heman, and jeduthun were there.
and their sons and relatives were there.
the levite singers were dressed in white linen.
they had cymbals, lyres, and harps.
there were 120 priests there with the levite singers.
the 120 priests blew trumpets.
those who blew the trumpets and those who sang were like one person.
they made one sound when they praised and thanked the lord.
they made a loud noise with the trumpets, cymbals, and instruments of music.
they praised the lord, singing, “the lord is good.
his faithful love will last forever.” then the lord’s temple was filled with a cloud.
the priests could not continue to serve because of the cloud, because the glory of the lord filled the temple.
chapter 50.
when israel died, joseph was very sad.
he hugged his father and cried over him and kissed him.
joseph commanded his servants to prepare his father’s body.
(these servants were doctors.)
the doctors prepared jacob’s body to be buried.
they prepared the body in the special way of the egyptians.
when the egyptians prepared the body in this special way, they waited 40 days before they buried the body.
then the egyptians had a special time of sadness for jacob.
this time was 70 days.
after the time of sadness was finished, joseph spoke to pharaoh’s officers and said, “please tell this to pharaoh: 
‘when my father was near death, i made a promise to him.
i promised that i would bury him in a cave in the land of canaan.
this is the cave that he prepared for himself.
so please let me go and bury my father.
then i will come back here to you.’” 
pharaoh answered, “keep your promise.
go and bury your father.” 
so joseph went to bury his father.
all of pharaoh’s officials, personal advisors, and all the older leaders of egypt went with joseph.
all the people in joseph’s family, his brothers, and all the people in his father’s family went with him.
only the children and the animals stayed in the land of goshen.
so there was a large crowd of people with him.
there was even a group of soldiers riding in chariots and some on horses.
they went to goren atad, east of the jordan river.
there they had a long funeral service for israel, which continued for seven days.
when the people who lived in canaan saw the funeral service at goren atad, they said, “this is a time of great sorrow for those egyptians.” so now that place across the jordan river is named abel mizraim.
so jacob’s sons did what their father told them.
they carried his body to canaan and buried it in the cave at machpelah.
this was the cave near mamre in the field that abraham bought from ephron the hittite.
abraham bought that cave to use as a burial place.
after joseph buried his father, he and everyone in the group with him went back to egypt.
after jacob died, joseph’s brothers were worried.
they were afraid that joseph would still be mad at them for what they had done years before.
they said, “maybe joseph still hates us for what we did.” 
so the brothers sent this message to joseph: “before your father died, he told us to give you a message.
he said, ‘tell joseph that i beg him to please forgive his brothers for the bad things they did to him.’ so now joseph, we beg you, please forgive us for the bad things we did to you.
we are the servants of god, the god of your father.” that message made joseph very sad, and he cried.
his brothers went to him and bowed down in front of him.
they said, “we will be your servants.” 
then joseph said to them, “don’t be afraid.
i am not god!
i have no right to punish you.
it is true that you planned to do something bad to me.
but really, god was planning good things.
god’s plan was to use me to save the lives of many people.
and that is what happened.
so don’t be afraid.
i will take care of you and your children.” and so joseph said kind things to his brothers, and this made them feel better.
joseph continued to live in egypt with his father’s family.
he died when he was 110 years old.
during joseph’s life ephraim had children and grandchildren.
and his son manasseh had a son named makir.
joseph lived to see makir’s children.
when joseph was near death, he said to his brothers, “my time to die is almost here.
but i know that god will take care of you and lead you out of this country.
god will lead you to the land he promised to give abraham, isaac, and jacob.” 
then joseph asked his people to make a promise.
joseph said, “promise me that you will carry my bones with you when god leads you out of egypt.” 
joseph died in egypt when he was 110 years old.
doctors prepared his body for burial and put the body in a coffin in egypt.
chapter 8.
the men of ephraim were angry with gideon.
when they found him, they asked, “why did you treat us this way?
why didn’t you call us when you went to fight against the midianites?” 
but gideon answered the men of ephraim, “i have not done as well as you.
you people of ephraim have a much better harvest than my family, the abiezers.
at harvest time you leave more grapes in the vineyard than my family gathers!
isn’t that true?
in the same way you have a better harvest now.
god allowed you to capture oreb and zeeb, the leaders of midian.
how can i compare my success with what you did?” when the men of ephraim heard gideon’s answer, they were not as angry as they had been.
then gideon and his 300 men came to the jordan river and went across to the other side, but they were tired and hungry.
gideon said to the men of the city of succoth, “give my soldiers something to eat.
they are very tired.
we are still chasing zebah and zalmunna, kings of midian.” 
but the leaders of the city of succoth said to gideon, “why should we give your soldiers something to eat?
you haven’t caught zebah and zalmunna yet.” 
then gideon said, “the lord will help me capture zebah and zalmunna.
and since you would not give us any food, i will come back and beat you with thorns and briers from the desert.” 
gideon left the city of succoth and went to the city of penuel.
he asked the men of penuel for food, just as he had asked the men of succoth.
but the men of penuel gave gideon the same answer that the men of succoth had given.
so gideon said to the men of penuel, “after i win the victory, i will come back here and pull this tower down.” 
zebah and zalmunna and their army were in the city of karkor.
their army had 15,000 soldiers in it.
these soldiers were all who were left of the army of the people of the east.
120,000 strong soldiers of that army had already been killed.
gideon and his men used tent dwellers’ road, which is east of the cities of nobah and jogbehah and attacked the enemy at karkor.
the enemy army did not expect the attack.
zebah and zalmunna, kings of the midianites, ran away.
but gideon chased and caught them.
gideon and his men defeated the enemy army.
then gideon son of joash returned from the battle.
he and his men returned by going through a mountain pass called the pass of heres.
gideon captured a young man from the city of succoth.
he asked the young man some questions.
the young man wrote down some names for gideon.
the young man wrote down the names of the leaders and elders of the city of succoth.
he gave gideon the names of 77 men.
when gideon came to the city of succoth, he said to the men of that city, “here are zebah and zalmunna.
you made fun of me by saying, ‘why should we give food to your tired soldiers?
you have not caught zebah and zalmunna yet.’” 
gideon took the elders of the city of succoth and beat them with thorns and briers from the desert.
gideon also pulled down the tower in the city of penuel and killed the men living in that city.
then gideon said to zebah and zalmunna, “you killed some men on mount tabor.
what were the men like?” zebah and zalmunna answered, “they were like you.
each one of them seemed like a prince.” 
gideon said, “those men were my brothers, my mother’s sons!
as the lord lives, if you had not killed them, i would not kill you now.” 
then gideon turned to jether, his oldest son, and said, “kill these kings.” but jether was only a boy and was afraid, so he would not take out his sword.
then zebah and zalmunna said to gideon, “come on, kill us yourself.
you are a man and strong enough to do the job.” so gideon got up and killed zebah and zalmunna.
then gideon took the decorations shaped like the moon off their camels’ necks.
the israelites said to gideon, “you saved us from the midianites.
so now rule over us.
we want you, your son, and your grandson to rule over us.” 
but gideon told the israelites, “the lord will be your ruler.
i will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you.” 
some of the people who the men of israel defeated were ishmaelites.
and the ishmaelite men wore gold earrings.
so gideon said to the israelites, “i want you to do this one thing for me.
i want each of you to give me a gold earring from the things you took in the battle.” 
the israelites said to gideon, “we will gladly give you what you want.” so they put a coat down on the ground, and each man threw an earring onto the coat.
when the earrings were gathered up, they weighed about 43 pounds.
this did not include the other gifts the israelites gave to gideon.
they also gave him jewelry shaped like the moon and jewelry shaped like teardrops.
and they gave him purple robes.
the kings of the midianites had worn these things.
they also gave him the chains from the camels of the midianite kings.
gideon used the gold to make an ephod, which he put in his hometown, the town called ophrah.
all the israelites worshiped the ephod.
in this way the israelites were not faithful to god—they worshiped the ephod.
the ephod became a trap that caused gideon and his family to sin.
the midianites were forced to be under the rule of the israelites.
the midianites did not cause trouble anymore.
and the land was at peace for 40 years, as long as gideon was alive.
gideon son of joash went home.
gideon had 70 sons of his own.
he had so many sons because he had many wives.
he had a slave woman who lived in the city of shechem.
he had a son by her.
he named that son abimelech.
so gideon son of joash died at a good old age.
he was buried in the tomb that joash, his father, owned.
that tomb is in the city of ophrah, where the family of abiezer lives.
as soon as gideon died, the israelites again were not faithful to god—they followed baal.
they made baal berith their god.
the israelites did not remember the lord their god, who had saved them from all their enemies living around them.
the israelites were not loyal to the family of jerub-baal (gideon), even though he had done many good things for them.
1 kings.
chapter 16.
then the lord spoke against king baasha through the prophet, jehu son of hanani.
he said, 
“i made you an important prince over my people israel.
but you have done the same things jeroboam did.
you have caused my people israel to sin.
their sins have made me angry.
so baasha, i will destroy you and your family, just as i did jeroboam son of nebat and his family.
dogs will eat the bodies of those in your family who die in the city.
and wild birds will eat the bodies of those who die out in the fields.” 
the rest of the story about baasha and the great things he did are written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
baasha died and was buried in tirzah.
his son elah became the new king after him.
that book also has the story of the time the lord gave the message to jehu the prophet about baasha and his family.
baasha did many things the lord said were wrong, just as jeroboam and his family had done.
this and the fact that baasha had killed everyone in jeroboam’s family made the lord very angry.
elah son of baasha became king during the 26th year that asa was the king of judah.
he ruled in tirzah for two years.
zimri was one of king elah’s officers.
zimri commanded half of elah’s chariots, but zimri plotted against elah.
king elah was in tirzah, drinking and getting drunk at arza’s home.
arza was the man in charge of the palace at tirzah.
zimri went into the house and killed king elah.
then zimri became the new king of israel after elah.
this was during the 27th year that asa was king in judah.
after zimri became the new king, he killed all of baasha’s family and friends.
he did not let any male in baasha’s family live.
so zimri destroyed baasha’s family just as the lord said he would when he spoke against baasha through the prophet jehu.
this happened because of all the sins of baasha and his son, elah.
they sinned and they caused the israelites to sin.
they worshiped worthless idols, and this made the lord angry.
the rest of what that elah did is written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
zimri became king of israel during the 27th year that asa was king of judah.
zimri ruled in tirzah only seven days.
this is what happened: the army of israel was at gibbethon, which was under philistine control.
omri was the commander of the army of israel.
the men in the camp heard that zimri had made secret plans against the king and killed him.
so in the camp all the soldiers made omri the new king.
then omri and all the soldiers of israel left gibbethon and went to tirzah.
they surrounded the city and attacked it.
when zimri saw the city had been captured, he ran to the palace fortress, but the soldiers burned it down with him still in it.
so zimri died because he sinned and did what the lord said was wrong, just as jeroboam did when he caused the israelites to sin.
the story about zimri’s secret plans and the other things that he did are written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
then the israelites were divided.
half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath and wanted to make him king.
the other half of the people followed omri.
but omri’s followers were stronger than the followers of tibni son of ginath.
tibni died, and omri became king.
omri became king of israel during asa’s 31st year as the king of judah.
omri ruled over israel for 12 years.
six of those years he ruled from tirzah.
then omri bought the hill of samaria from shemer for about 150 pounds of silver.
omri built a city on that hill.
he named the city samaria after the name of its owner, shemer.
omri did what the lord said was wrong.
he was worse than all the kings who were before him.
he committed all the sins that jeroboam son of nebat had committed when he caused the israelites to sin.
they worshiped worthless idols, and this made the lord, the god of israel, very angry.
the rest of the story about omri and the great things he did are written in the book, the history of the kings of israel.
omri died and was buried in samaria.
his son ahab became the new king after him.
ahab son of omri became king of israel during the 38th year that asa was king of judah.
ahab ruled israel from the town of samaria for 22 years.
he did what the lord said was wrong.
ahab was worse than all the kings who were before him.
it was not enough for ahab to commit the same sins that jeroboam, son of nebat, had done.
ahab also married jezebel, daughter of king ethbaal of sidon.
then ahab began to serve and worship baal.
he built a temple and an altar in samaria for worshiping baal.
he also set up a sacred pole.
ahab did more to make the lord, the god of israel, angry than all the other kings who were before him.
during ahab’s time, hiel from bethel rebuilt the town of jericho.
when hiel started work on the city, his oldest son abiram died.
and when hiel built the gates of the city, his youngest son segub died.
this happened just as the lord said it would happen when he spoke through joshua son of nun.
chapter 12.
while moses and aaron were still in egypt, the lord spoke to them.
he said, 
“this month will be the first month of the year for you.
this command is for the whole community of israel: on the tenth day of this month each man must get one lamb for the people in his house.
if there are not enough people in his house to eat a whole lamb, then he should invite some of his neighbors to share the meal.
there must be enough lamb for everyone to eat.
the lamb must be a one-year-old male, and it must be completely healthy.
this animal can be either a young sheep or a young goat.
you should watch over the animal until the 14th day of the month.
on that day all the people of the community of israel must kill these animals just before dark.
you must collect the blood from these animals and put it on the top and sides of the doorframe of every house where the people eat this meal.
“on this night you must roast the lamb and eat all the meat.
you must also eat bitter herbs and bread made without yeast.
you must not eat the lamb raw or boiled in water.
you must roast the whole lamb over a fire.
the lamb must still have its head, legs, and inner parts.
you must eat all the meat that night.
if any of the meat is left until morning, you must burn it in the fire.
“when you eat the meal, you must be fully dressed and ready to travel.
you must have your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand.
you must eat in a hurry, because this is the lord’s passover.
“tonight i will go through egypt and kill every firstborn man and animal in egypt.
in this way i will judge all the gods of egypt and show that i am the lord.
but the blood on your houses will be a special sign.
when i see the blood, i will pass over your house.
i will cause bad things to happen to the people of egypt.
but none of these bad diseases will hurt you.
“you will always remember tonight—it will be a special festival for you.
your descendants will honor the lord with this festival forever.
for this festival you will eat bread made without yeast for seven days.
on the first day, you will remove all the yeast from your houses.
no one should eat any yeast for the full seven days of this festival.
anyone who eats yeast must be separated from the rest of israel.
there will be holy assemblies on the first day and the last day of the festival.
you must not do any work on these days.
the only work you can do is preparing the food for your meals.
you must remember the festival of unleavened bread, because on this day i took all of your people out of egypt in groups.
all of your descendants must remember this day.
this is a law that will last forever.
so on the evening of the 14th day of the first month, you will begin eating bread without yeast.
you will eat this bread until the evening of the 21st day of the same month.
for seven days, there must not be any yeast in your houses.
anyone, either a citizen of israel or a foreigner living among you, who eats yeast at this time must be separated from the rest of israel.
during this festival you must not eat any yeast.
you must eat bread without yeast wherever you live.” 
so moses called all the elders together and told them, “get the lambs for your families.
kill the lambs for the passover.
take bunches of hyssop and dip them in the bowls filled with blood.
paint the blood on the sides and top of each doorframe.
no one must leave their house until morning.
at the time the lord goes through egypt to kill the firstborn, he will see the blood on the sides and top of each doorframe.
then he will protect that house and not let the destroyer come into any of your houses and hurt you.
you must remember this command.
this law is for you and your descendants forever.
you must remember to do this even when you go to the land the lord is giving you.
when your children ask you, ‘why are we doing this ceremony?’ 
you will say, ‘this passover is to honor the lord, because when we were in egypt, he passed over the houses of israel.
he killed the egyptians, but he saved the people in our houses.’” then the people bowed down and worshiped the lord.
the lord had given this command to moses and aaron, so the israelites did what the lord commanded.
at midnight the lord killed all the firstborn sons in egypt, from the firstborn son of pharaoh (who ruled egypt) to the firstborn son of the prisoner sitting in jail.
also all the firstborn animals died.
that night someone died in every house in egypt.
pharaoh, his officials, and all the people of egypt began to cry loudly.
so that night pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said to them, “get up and leave my people.
you and your people can do as you say.
go and worship the lord.
take all of your sheep and cattle with you, just as you said you would.
and say a blessing for me too.” 
the people of egypt also asked them to hurry and leave.
they said, “if you don’t leave, we will all die!” 
the israelites did not have time to put the yeast in their bread.
they just wrapped the bowls of dough with cloth and carried them on their shoulders.
then the israelites did what moses asked them to do.
they went to their egyptian neighbors and asked for clothing and things made from silver and gold.
the lord caused the egyptians to be kind to the israelites, so the egyptians gave their riches to the israelites.
the israelites traveled from rameses to succoth.
there were about 600,000 men, not counting the small boys.
a great number of people who were not israelites went with them, along with many sheep, cattle, and other livestock.
the people did not have time to put yeast in their bread or make any special food for their journey.
so they had to bake their bread without yeast.
the israelites had lived in egypt for 430 years.
after 430 years, to the very day, all the armies of the lord left egypt.
the night they left, the lord watched over them to bring them safely out of egypt.
so the israelites will always celebrate this night each year to remember what the lord did.
the lord told moses and aaron, “these are the rules for passover: no foreigner is allowed to eat the passover.
a foreigner who is only a hired worker or is only staying in your country is not allowed to eat the passover.
but if someone buys a slave and circumcises him, then the slave can eat the passover.
“each family must eat the meal in one house.
none of the food is to be taken outside the house.
don’t break any of the lamb’s bones.
the whole community of israel must do this ceremony.
if a foreigner living among you wants to share in the lord’s passover, he must be circumcised.
then he can share in the meal like any other citizen of israel.
but a man who is not circumcised cannot eat the passover meal.
the same rules are for everyone.
it doesn’t matter if they are citizens or foreigners living among you.” 
so all the israelites obeyed the commands that the lord gave to moses and aaron.
on that same day the lord led all the israelites out of the country of egypt.
the people left in groups.
chapter 19.
the lord said to me, “you must sing this sad song about the leaders of israel: 
“‘your mother is like a female lion, lying there with the male lions.
she went to lie down with the young male lions and had many babies.
one of her cubs gets up.
he has grown to be a strong young lion.
he has learned to catch his food.
he killed and ate a man.
“‘the people heard him roar, and they caught him in their trap.
they put hooks in his mouth and carried the young lion to egypt.
“‘the mother lion had hoped that cub would become the leader, but now she has lost all hope.
so she took another of her cubs and trained him to be a lion.
he hunted with the adult lions and became a strong young lion.
he learned to catch his food.
he killed and ate a man.
he attacked the palaces and destroyed the cities.
everyone in that country was too afraid to speak when hearing his growl.
then the people who lived around him set a trap for him, and they caught him in their trap.
they put hooks on him and locked him up.
they had him in their trap, so they took him to the king of babylon.
and now, you cannot hear his roar on the mountains of israel.
“‘your mother is like a grapevine planted near the water.
she had plenty of water, so she grew many strong vines.
then she grew large branches.
they were like a strong walking stick.
they were like a king’s scepter.
the vine grew taller and taller.
it had many branches and reached to the clouds.
but the vine was pulled up by the roots, and thrown down to the ground.
the hot east wind blew and dried its fruit.
the strong branches broke, and they were thrown into the fire.
“‘now that grapevine is planted in the desert.
it is a very dry and thirsty land.
a fire started in the large branch and spread to destroy all of its vines and fruit.
so there was no strong walking stick.
there was no king’s scepter.’ this was a sad song about death, and it was sung as a sad song about death.” 
ezekiel.
chapter 2.
the voice said, “son of man, stand up and i will speak with you.” 
then the spirit came into me and lifted me up on my feet, and i listened to the one who spoke to me.
he said, “son of man, i am sending you to speak to the family of israel.
those people and their ancestors turned against me many times.
they have sinned against me many times—and they are still sinning against me today.
i am sending you to speak to them, but they are very stubborn.
they are very hardheaded, but you must speak to them.
you must say, ‘this is what the lord god says.’ 
they are people who refuse to obey, so they may not listen to you.
but even if they don’t stop sinning, at least they will know that there is a prophet living among them.
“son of man, don’t be afraid of the people or what they say.
it is true: they will turn against you and try to hurt you.
their words will be sharp like thorns and will sting like scorpions.
but don’t be afraid of what they say.
they are people who refuse to obey, but don’t be afraid of them.
you must tell them what i say, whether they listen or not.
they are people who usually refuse to listen!
“son of man, listen to what i am telling you.
don’t turn against me like those people who refuse to obey.
now open your mouth to receive the words i will give you to speak.” 
then i saw an arm reach out toward me.
it was holding a scroll with words written on it.
it rolled the scroll open in front of me.
words were on the front and on the back of the scroll.
there were all kinds of sad songs, sad stories, and warnings.
chapter 8.
then the lord told moses, “go to pharaoh and tell him that the lord says, ‘let my people go to worship me!
if you refuse to let my people go, then i will fill egypt with frogs.
the nile river will be filled with frogs.
they will come from the river and enter your houses.
they will be in your bedrooms and in your beds.
they will be in the houses of your officials and in your ovens and in your jars of water.
the frogs will be all over you, your people, and your officials.’” 
then the lord said to moses, “tell aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the canals, rivers, and lakes.
then the frogs will come out onto the land of egypt.” 
so aaron raised his hand over the waters of egypt, and the frogs began coming out of the water and covered the land of egypt.
the magicians used their magic to do the same thing—so even more frogs came out onto the land in egypt!
pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said, “ask the lord to remove the frogs from me and my people.
i will let the people go to offer sacrifices to the lord.” 
moses said to pharaoh, “i will pray for you, your people, and your officials.
then the frogs will leave you and your houses.
they will remain only in the river.
when do you want the frogs to go away?” 
pharaoh said, “tomorrow.” moses said, “it will happen as you say.
in this way you will know that there is no god like the lord our god.
the frogs will leave you, your house, your officials, and your people.
they will remain only in the river.” 
moses and aaron left pharaoh.
moses prayed to the lord about the frogs he had sent against pharaoh.
and the lord did what moses asked.
the frogs died in the houses, in the yards, and in the fields.
they began to rot, and the whole country began to stink.
but when pharaoh saw that they were free of the frogs, he again became stubborn.
pharaoh did not do what moses and aaron had asked him to do.
this happened just as the lord had said.
then the lord said to moses, “tell aaron to raise his stick and hit the dust on the ground, and everywhere in egypt dust will become lice.” 
they did this.
aaron raised the stick in his hand and hit the dust on the ground, and everywhere in egypt the dust became lice.
the lice got on the animals and the people.
the magicians used their magic and tried to do the same thing.
but the magicians could not make lice come from the dust.
the lice remained on the animals and the people.
so the magicians told pharaoh that the power of god did this.
but pharaoh refused to listen to them.
this happened just as the lord had said.
the lord said to moses, “get up in the morning and go to pharaoh.
he will go out to the river.
tell him that the lord says, ‘let my people go and worship me!
if you don’t let my people go, then flies will come into your houses.
the flies will be on you and your officials.
the houses of egypt will be full of flies.
they will be all over the ground too!
but i will not treat the israelites the same as the egyptians.
there will not be any flies in goshen, where my people live.
in this way you will know that i, the lord, am in this land.
so tomorrow i will treat my people differently from your people.
this will be my proof.’” 
so the lord did just what he said.
millions of flies came into egypt.
the flies were in pharaoh’s house, and they were in all his officials’ houses.
they were all over egypt.
the flies were ruining the country.
so pharaoh called for moses and aaron and told them, “offer sacrifices to your god here in this country.” 
but moses said, “it would not be right to do that.
the egyptians think it is terrible to kill animals as sacrifices for the lord our god.
if we do this here, the egyptians will see us and throw stones at us and kill us.
let us go three days into the desert and offer sacrifices to the lord our god.
this is what he told us to do.” 
so pharaoh said, “i will let you go and offer sacrifices to the lord your god in the desert, but you must not go very far.
now, go and pray for me.” 
moses said, “look, i will leave and ask the lord to remove the flies from you, your people, and your officials tomorrow.
but you must not stop the people from offering sacrifices to the lord.” 
so moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord.
and the lord did what moses asked.
he removed the flies from pharaoh, his officials, and his people.
none of the flies remained.
but pharaoh again became stubborn and did not let the people go.
chapter 74.
a maskil of asaph.
god, why have you turned away from us for so long?
why are you still angry with us, your own flock?
remember the people you bought so long ago.
you saved us, and we belong to you.
and remember mount zion, the place where you lived.
god, come walk through these ancient ruins.
come back to the holy place that the enemy destroyed.
the enemy shouted their war cries in the temple.
they put up their flags there to show they had won the war.
their soldiers attacked the doors, like workmen chopping down trees.
using axes and hatchets, they smashed the carved panels inside.
they burned down your holy place.
it was built to honor your name, but they pulled it down to the ground.
the enemy decided to crush us completely.
they burned every holy place in the country.
we do not see any of our signs.
there are no more prophets.
and no one knows how long this will last.
god, how much longer will the enemy make fun of us?
will you let them insult your name forever?
why won’t you help us?
use your power to defeat our enemies!
god, you have been our king for a long time.
you have saved us many times on this earth.
with your great power you split open the sea and broke the heads of the sea monster.
yes, you smashed the heads of leviathan and left his body for animals to eat.
you make the springs and rivers flow, and you make the rivers dry up.
you control the day and the night.
you made the sun and the moon.
you set the limits for everything on earth.
and you created summer and winter.
lord, remember, the enemy insulted you!
those foolish people hate your name!
don’t give us like a helpless dove to those wild animals.
never forget your poor, suffering people.
remember the agreement you gave us, because violence fills every dark place in this land.
your people were treated badly.
don’t let them be hurt anymore.
let your poor, helpless people praise you.
god, get up and defend yourself!
remember, those fools challenged you.
don’t forget the shouts of your enemies.
they insulted you again and again.
chapter 14.
the lord will again show his love to jacob.
he will again choose the people of israel.
he will give them their land.
then the non-israelites will join the israelites, and both will become one family—jacob’s family.
those nations will bring the israelites back to their land.
the men and women from the other nations will become slaves to israel.
in the past, those people forced the israelites to become their slaves.
but in the future the israelites will defeat those nations, and israel will then rule over them in the lord’s land.
in the past, you were slaves.
people forced you to work hard.
but the lord will take away the hard work you were forced to do.
at that time you will begin to sing this song about the king of babylon: the king was cruel when he ruled us, but now his rule is finished.
the lord breaks the scepter of evil rulers; he takes away their power.
in anger, the king of babylon beat the people.
he never stopped beating them.
he was an evil ruler who ruled in anger.
he never stopped hurting people.
but now, the whole country rests and is quiet.
now the people begin to celebrate.
you were an evil king, and now you are finished.
even the pine trees are happy.
the cedar trees of lebanon rejoice.
they say, “the king chopped us down, but now the king has fallen, and he will never stand again.” 
the place of death is excited that you are coming.
sheol is waking the spirits of all the leaders of the earth for you.
sheol is making the kings stand up from their thrones to meet you.
they will make fun of you, saying, “now you are as dead as we are.
now you are just like us.” 
your pride has been sent down to sheol.
the music from your harps announces the coming of your proud spirit.
maggots will be the bed you lie on, and other worms will cover your body like a blanket.
you were like the morning star, but you have fallen from the sky.
in the past, all the nations on earth bowed down before you, but now you have been cut down.
you always told yourself, “i will go to the skies above.
i will put my throne above god’s stars.
i will sit on zaphon, the holy mountain where the gods meet.
i will go up to the altar above the tops of the clouds.
i will be like god most high.” 
but that did not happen.
you were brought down to the deep pit—sheol, the place of death.
people will come to look at your dead body.
they will think about you and say, “is this the same man who caused great fear in all the kingdoms on earth, 
who destroyed cities and turned the land into a desert, who captured people in war and would not let them go home?” 
the kings of other nations lie buried with honor, each king with his own grave.
but you were thrown out of your grave like a branch cut from a tree and thrown away.
you are like a dead man who fell in battle, trampled under the feet of other soldiers.
now you look like any other dead man wrapped in burial clothes.
other kings have their own graves, but you will not join them, because you ruined your own country and killed your own people.
so your wicked descendants will be stopped.
prepare to kill his children, because their father is guilty.
his children will never take control of the land.
they will never fill the world with their cities.
the lord all-powerful said, “i will stand and fight against those people.
i will destroy the famous city, babylon.
i will destroy all the people there.
i will destroy their children, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren.” the lord himself said this.
“i will change babylon.
it will be a place for animals, not people.
it will be a swamp.
i will use the ‘broom of destruction’ to sweep babylon away.” the lord all-powerful said this.
the lord all-powerful made this promise: “this will happen exactly as i meant for it to happen.
it will happen just the way i planned.
i will destroy the king of assyria in my country.
i will walk on him on my mountains.
he forced my people to be his slaves; he put a yoke on their necks.
but that pole will be taken off judah’s neck, and that burden will be removed.
this is what i plan to do for this land.
i will use my power to punish all those nations.” 
when the lord all-powerful makes a plan, no one can change it.
when he raises his arm to punish, no one can stop him.
this message was given to me the year king ahaz died: 
country of philistia, don’t be happy that the king who beat you is now dead.
it is true that his rule has ended, but his son will come and rule.
it will be like one snake giving birth to a more dangerous one.
the new king will be like a quick and dangerous snake to you.
but even the poorest of my people will be able to eat safely.
and their children will be able to lie down and feel safe.
but i will make your family die from hunger, and your enemy will kill anyone who survives.
people near the city gates, cry!
people in the city, cry out!
everyone in philistia, your courage will melt like hot wax.
look to the north!
there is a cloud of dust.
an army is coming, and everyone in that army is strong.
but what will the messengers from that nation report about us?
they will say, “the lord made zion strong, and his poor people went there for safety.” 
deuteronomy.
chapter 17.
“you must not sacrifice to the lord your god an ox or sheep that has anything wrong with it.
the lord your god would hate that.
“you might hear about an evil thing that happens in one of the cities that the lord your god is giving you.
you might hear that a man or woman in your group has sinned against the lord your god.
you might hear that they have broken his agreement or 
that they have worshiped other gods or maybe the sun, the moon or the stars.
i never told you to do that!
if you hear bad news like this, you must check it carefully.
you must learn if it is true that this terrible thing has really happened in israel.
if you prove that it is true, 
you must punish the person who did this evil thing.
you must take that man or woman out to a public place near the city gates and kill them with stones.
but no one should be punished with death if only one witness says that person did that evil thing.
but if two or three witnesses say it is true, the person must be killed.
the witnesses must throw the first stones to kill that person.
then the other people should throw stones to finish killing that person.
in this way you will remove this evil from your group.
“there might be some problems that are too hard for your courts to judge.
it might be a murder case or an argument between two people.
or it might be a fight in which someone was hurt.
when these cases are argued in your towns, your judges there might not be able to decide what is right.
then you must go to the special place that the lord your god will choose.
you must go to the priests who are levites and to the judge on duty at that time.
they will decide what to do about that problem.
there at the lord’s special place they will tell you their decision.
you must do whatever they say.
be sure to do everything they tell you to do.
you must accept their decision and follow their instructions exactly—don’t change anything!
“you must punish anyone who refuses to obey the judge or the priest who is there at that time serving the lord your god.
that person must die.
you must remove this evil person from israel.
all the people will hear about this punishment and be afraid.
then they will not be stubborn anymore.
“you will enter the land that the lord your god is giving you.
you will take that land and live in it.
then you will say, ‘we will put a king over us, like all the nations around us.’ 
when that happens, you must be sure to choose the king that the lord your god chooses.
the king over you must be one of your own people.
you must not make a foreigner your king.
the king must not get more and more horses for himself.
and he must not send people to egypt to get more horses, because the lord has told you, ‘you must never go back that way.’ 
also, the king must not have too many wives, because that will make him turn away from the lord.
and he must not make himself rich with silver and gold.
“when the king begins to rule, he must write a copy of the law for himself in a book.
he must make that copy from the books that the priests from the tribe of levi keep.
he must keep that book with him and read from it all his life, because he must learn to respect the lord his god.
he must learn to completely obey everything the law commands.
then the king will not think that he is better than any of his own people.
he will not turn away from the law, but he will follow it exactly.
then he and his descendants will rule the kingdom of israel a long time.
chapter 32.
“skies, listen and i will speak.
earth, hear the words of my mouth.
my teachings will come like the rain, like a mist falling to the ground, like a gentle rain on the soft grass, like rain on the green plants.
praise god as i speak the lord’s name!
“the lord is the rock, and his work is perfect!
yes, all his ways are right!
god is true and faithful.
he is good and honest.
and you are not really his children.
you are completely unfaithful to him.
you are crooked liars.
is this the way you repay the lord for all he has done for you?
you are stupid, foolish people.
he is your father and your creator.
he made you, and he supports you.
“remember the days of the past.
think about what happened so long ago.
ask your father; he will tell you.
ask your leaders; they will tell you.
god most high separated the people on earth and gave each nation its land.
he set up borders for all people.
he made as many nations as there are angels.
the lord chose his people to be his own.
the people of jacob belong to him.
“the lord found them in the desert, in an empty, windy land.
he surrounded them and watched over them.
he protected them like the pupil of his eye, 
like an eagle when she makes her young leave the nest to fly.
she stays close to them, ready to help.
she spreads her wings to catch them when they fall and carries them to a safe place.
the lord alone led his people.
they had no help from any foreign god.
the lord helped them take control of the hill country.
they took the harvest in the fields.
he gave them honey from the cliffs and olive oil from the rocky ground.
he gave his people butter from the herd and milk from the flock.
he gave them lambs and goats.
they had the best rams from bashan and the finest wheat.
they drank the best wine made from the juice of red grapes.
“but jeshurun became fat and kicked like a bull.
(yes, you people were fed well and became full and fat.)
they left the god who made them!
they ran away from the rock who saved them.
they made him jealous by worshiping other gods.
they made him angry with those disgusting idols.
they offered sacrifices to demons—gods that are not god.
these were new gods they had not known before, gods their ancestors never knew.
you people left the rock who made you; you forgot the god who gave you life.
“the lord saw this and became upset.
his sons and daughters made him angry!
so he said, ‘i will turn away from them, then let’s see what happens!
they are a rebellious people.
they are like children who will not learn their lessons.
they made me jealous with things that are not really gods.
they made me angry with their worthless idols.
so i will use people who are not really a nation to make them jealous.
i will use a worthless nation to make them angry.
my anger will burn like a fire, burning down to the deepest grave, burning the earth and all it produces, burning deep down below the mountains.
“‘i will bring troubles to the israelites.
i will shoot all my arrows at them.
they will become thin from hunger.
terrible diseases will destroy them.
i will send wild animals against them.
poisonous snakes and lizards will bite them.
in the streets, soldiers will kill them.
in their houses, terrible things will happen.
soldiers will kill young men and women.
they will kill babies and old people.
“‘i thought about destroying the israelites so that people would forget them completely!
but i know what their enemies would say.
the enemy would not understand.
they would brag and say, “the lord did not destroy israel.
we won by our own power!”’ 
“they are foolish.
they don’t understand.
if they were wise, they would understand; they would know what would happen to them.
can one person chase away 1000 men?
can two men cause 10,000 men to run away?
it will happen only if the lord gives them to their enemy.
this will happen only if their rock sells them like slaves.
the ‘rock’ of our enemies is not strong like our rock.
even our enemies know that.
their vines and fields will be destroyed like sodom and gomorrah.
their grapes are like bitter poison.
their wine is like the poison of deadly snakes.
“the lord says, ‘i am saving that punishment.
i have it locked up in my storehouse!
i will punish them for the bad things they did.
but i am saving that punishment for when they slip and do bad things.
their time of trouble is near.
their punishment will come quickly.’ 
“the lord will judge his people.
they are his servants, and he will show them mercy.
he will see that their power is gone.
he will see that they are all helpless— the slaves and free people too.
then the lord will say, ‘where are the false gods?
where is the “rock” that you ran to for protection?
those false gods ate the fat of your sacrifices.
and they drank the wine of your offerings.
so let them get up and help you!
let them protect you!
“‘now, see that i, and only i, am god!
there is no other god!
i put people to death, and i let people live.
i can hurt people, and i can make them well.
no one can save another person from my power!
i raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise.
as surely as i live forever, these things will happen!
i swear, i will sharpen my flashing sword.
i will use it to punish my enemies.
i will give them the punishment they deserve.
my enemies will be killed and taken as prisoners.
my arrows will be covered with their blood.
my sword will cut off the heads of their soldiers.’ 
“the whole world should be happy for god’s people!
god punishes people who kill his servants.
he gives his enemies the punishment they deserve.
and he makes his land and people pure.” 
moses and joshua son of nun came and sang all the words of this song for the israelites to hear.
when moses finished giving these teachings to the people, 
he said to them, “you must be sure to pay attention to all the commands i tell you today.
and you must tell your children to obey completely the commands in this law.
don’t think these teachings are not important.
they are your life!
through these teachings you will live a long time in the land across the jordan river that you are ready to take.” 
the lord spoke to moses that same day.
he said, 
“go to the abarim mountains.
go up on mount nebo in the land of moab across from the city of jericho.
then you can look at the land of canaan that i am giving to the israelites to live in.
you will die on that mountain.
you will go to be with your people, the same as your brother aaron died on mount hor.
this is because you both sinned against me.
you were at the waters of meribah near kadesh, in the desert of zin.
there, in front of the israelites, you did not honor me and show that i am holy.
so now you may see the land that i am giving to the israelites.
but you cannot go into that land.” 
deuteronomy.
chapter 22.
“if you see that your neighbor’s ox or sheep is loose, you must not ignore it.
be sure to take it back to its owner.
if the owner does not live near you or if you don’t know who it belongs to, take the ox or sheep to your house.
keep it there until the owner comes looking for it; then give it back.
you must do the same thing when you find anything that your neighbor might have lost.
don’t try selling it to your neighbor—you must give it back.
“if your neighbor’s donkey or ox has fallen down on the road, you must not ignore it.
you must help your neighbor lift it up again.
“a woman must not wear men’s clothes, and a man must not wear women’s clothes.
that is disgusting to the lord your god.
“you might be walking along a path and find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground.
if the mother bird is sitting with her baby birds or on the eggs, you must not take the mother bird with the babies.
you may take the babies for yourself, but you must let the mother go.
if you obey these laws, things will go well for you, and you will live a long time.
“when you build a new house, you must build a wall around your roof.
then you will not be guilty for the death of a person who falls from the house.
“you must not plant seeds of grain in the same fields as your grapevines.
because then they become useless—both the grapes and the grain produced by the seeds you planted.
“you must not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
“you must not wear clothes made by weaving together wool and linen.
“tie several pieces of thread together.
then put these tassels on the four corners of the robes you wear.
“a man might marry a woman and have sexual relations with her.
then he might decide that he does not like her.
he might accuse her of doing wrong and say, ‘i married this woman, but when we had sexual relations, i found she was not a virgin.’ by saying this against her, people might think bad things about her.
if this happens, the girl’s father and mother must bring the proof that the girl was a virgin to the town elders at the meeting place of the town.
the girl’s father must say to the leaders, ‘i gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, but now he does not want her.
this man accused my daughter of doing wrong and said, “i did not find the proof that your daughter is a virgin.” but here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin.’ then they should show the cloth to the town leaders.
then the leaders of that town must take that man and punish him.
they must fine him 40 ounces of silver.
they will give the money to the girl’s father because her husband brought shame to an israelite girl.
and the girl will continue to be the man’s wife.
he cannot divorce her for the rest of his life.
“but what the husband said about his wife might be true.
the wife’s parents might not have the proof that she was a virgin.
if this happens, 
the town leaders must bring the girl to the door of her father’s house.
then the men of the town must kill her with stones, because she has done a shameful thing in israel.
she has acted like a prostitute in her father’s house.
you must remove this evil from your group.
“if a man is found having sexual relations with another man’s wife, both of them must die—the woman and the man who had sexual relations with her.
you must remove this evil from israel.
“a man might meet a virgin girl engaged to another man.
he might have sexual relations with her.
if this happens in the city, 
you must bring them both out to the public place near the gate of that city, and you must kill them with stones.
you must kill the man, because he used another man’s wife for sexual sin.
and you must kill the girl, because she was in the city but did not call for help.
you must remove this evil from your people.
“but if a man finds an engaged girl out in the field and forces her to have sexual relations with him, only the man must die.
you must do nothing to the girl.
she did nothing that deserves the punishment of death.
this is like someone attacking their neighbor and killing them.
the man found the engaged girl out in the field and attacked her.
maybe she called for help, but there was no one to help her.
“a man might find a virgin girl who is not engaged and force her to have sexual relations with him.
if other people see this happen, 
he must pay the girl’s father 20 ounces of silver.
and the girl will become the man’s wife, because he used her for sexual sin.
he cannot divorce her all his life.
“a man must not bring shame to his father by marrying his father’s wife.

jedaiah was shimri’s son, and shimri was shemaiah’s son.
these men’s families grew to be very large.
they went to the area outside the town of gedor to the east side of the valley.
they went to that place to look for fields for their sheep and cattle.
they found good fields with plenty of grass.
they found plenty of good land there.
the land was peaceful and quiet.
ham’s descendants lived there in the past.
this happened during the time that hezekiah was king of judah.
these men came to gedor and fought against the hamites.
they destroyed the tents of the hamites.
they also fought against the meunites who lived there.
these men destroyed all the meunites.
there are no meunites in this place even today.
so these men began to live there.
they lived there because the land had grass for their sheep.
five hundred people from the tribe of simeon went to the hill country of seir.
ishi’s sons led these men.
the sons were pelatiah, neariah, rephaiah, and uzziel.
the simeonite men fought against the people living in that place.
there were only a few amalekites still living, and these simeonites killed them.
since that time until now, the simeonites have lived in seir.
chapter 10.
during the third year that cyrus was the king of persia, these things were shown to daniel.
(daniel’s other name is belteshazzar.)
they are true, but very hard to understand.
daniel understood them because they were explained to him in a vision.
at that time i, daniel, was very sad for three weeks.
during those three weeks, i didn’t eat any fancy food; i didn’t eat any meat or drink any wine.
i didn’t put any oil on my head.
i didn’t do any of these things for three weeks.
on the 24th day of the first month of the year, i was standing beside the great tigris river.
while i was standing there, i looked up and i saw a man standing in front of me.
he was wearing linen clothes.
he wore a belt made of pure gold around his waist.
his body was like a smooth, shiny stone.
his face was bright like lightning.
his eyes were like flames of fire.
his arms and feet were shiny like polished brass.
his voice was loud like a crowd of people.
i, daniel, was the only one who saw the vision.
the men with me didn’t see the vision, but they were still afraid.
they were so afraid that they ran away and hid.
so i was left alone.
i was watching this vision, and it made me afraid.
i lost my strength.
my face turned white like a dead person’s face, and i was helpless.
then i heard the man in the vision talking.
as i listened to his voice, i fell into a deep sleep, with my face on the ground.
then a hand touched me.
when that happened, i got on my hands and knees.
i was so afraid that i was shaking.
the man in the vision said to me, “daniel, god loves you very much.
think very carefully about the words i will speak to you.
stand up; i have been sent to you.” and when he said this, i stood up.
i was still shaking because i was afraid.
then the man in the vision started talking again.
he said, “daniel, do not be afraid.
from the very first day you decided to get wisdom and to be humble in front of god, he has been listening to your prayers.
i came to you because you have been praying.
but the prince of persia has been fighting against me for 21 days.
then michael, one of the most important princes, came to help me because i was stuck there with the king of persia.
now i have come to you, daniel, to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future.
the vision is about a time in the future.” 
while the man was talking to me, i bowed low with my face toward the ground.
i could not speak.
then the one who looked like a man touched my lips.
i opened my mouth and started to speak.
i said to the one standing in front of me, “sir, i am upset and afraid because of what i saw in the vision.
i feel helpless.
sir, i am daniel your servant.
how can i talk with you?
my strength is gone and it is hard for me to breathe.” 
the one who looked like a man touched me again.
when he touched me, i felt better.
then he said, “daniel, don’t be afraid.
god loves you very much.
peace be with you.
be strong now, be strong.” when he spoke to me, i became stronger.
then i said, “sir, you have given me strength.
now you can speak.” 
so then he said, “daniel, do you know why i have come to you?
soon i must go back to fight against the prince of persia.
when i go, the prince of greece will come.
but daniel, before i go, i must first tell you what is written in the book of truth.
no one stands with me against those evil angels except michael, the prince over your people.
chapter 68.
to the director: a praise song of david.
god, get up and scatter your enemies!
may all your enemies run from you.
may your enemies be scattered like smoke blown away by the wind.
may your enemies be destroyed like wax melting in a fire.
but let good people be happy.
let them gather before god and enjoy themselves together.
sing to god!
sing praises to his name!
prepare the way for the one who rides on the clouds.
his name is yah.
worship before him with joy.
god, who lives in his holy palace, is a father to orphans, and he takes care of widows.
god provides homes for those who are lonely.
he frees people from prison and makes them happy.
but those who turn against him will live in the desert.
god, you led your people out of egypt.
you marched across the desert.
selah 
the ground shook and rain poured from the sky when god, the god of israel, came to sinai.
god, you sent the rain to make a tired, old land strong again.
your people came back to live there, and you provided good things for the poor.
my lord gave the command, and many people went to tell the good news: 
“the armies of powerful kings ran away!
at home, the women divide the things brought from the battle.
those who stayed home will share in the wealth— metal doves with wings covered in silver and feathers sparkling with gold.” 
god all-powerful scattered the kings like snow falling on mount zalmon.
mount bashan is a great mountain with many high peaks.
but, bashan, why are you jealous of mount zion?
that is where god has chosen to live.
the lord will live there forever.
with his millions of chariots, the lord came from sinai into the holy place.
you went up to your high place, leading a parade of captives.
you received gifts from people, even those who turned against you.
the lord god went up there to live.
praise the lord!
every day he helps us with the loads we must carry.
he is the god who saves us.
selah 
he is our god, the god who saves us.
my lord god saves us from death.
god will smash the heads of his enemies.
he will punish those who fight against him.
my lord said, “if they run up to bashan or down to the depths of the sea, i will bring them back.
so you will march through pools of their blood, and there will be plenty left for your dogs.” 
god, everyone can see your victory parade— the victory march of my god and king into his holy place!
singers come marching in front, followed by the musicians; they are surrounded by young girls playing tambourines.
praise god in the meeting place.
praise the lord, people of israel!
there is the smallest tribe, benjamin, leading them.
and there comes a large group of leaders from judah.
following them are the leaders of zebulun and naphtali.
god, show us your power!
show us the power you used for us in the past.
kings will bring their wealth to you, to your temple in jerusalem.
punish the people in egypt.
they are like cattle in the marshes, like bulls among the calves.
you humiliated them.
you scattered them in war.
now let them come crawling to you, bringing their pieces of silver.
messengers from egypt will come bearing gifts.
ethiopia will offer god their tribute.
kings on earth, sing to god!
sing songs of praise to our lord!
selah 
sing to him who rides his chariot through the ancient skies.
listen to his powerful voice!
tell everyone how powerful he is!
he rules over israel.
his power fills the skies.
god, you are awesome in your temple!
the god of israel is the one who gives strength and power to his people.
praise god!
chapter 24.
balaam saw that the lord wanted to bless israel, so he did not try to change that by using any kind of magic.
but balaam turned and looked toward the desert.
he looked out across the desert and saw all the israelites.
they were camped with the tribes in their different areas.
then the spirit of god came on him, 
and he gave this message: “this message is from balaam son of beor.
i am speaking about things i see clearly.
these are the words i heard from god.
i saw what god all-powerful showed me.
i humbly tell what i clearly see.
“people of jacob, your tents are beautiful!
israelites, your homes are beautiful!
you are like rows of palm trees planted by the streams.
you are like gardens growing by the rivers.
you are like sweet-smelling bushes planted by the lord.
you are like cedar trees growing by the water.
you will always have enough water, enough water for your seeds to grow.
your king will be greater than king agag.
your kingdom will be very great.
“god brought them out of egypt.
they are as strong as a wild ox.
they will defeat all their enemies.
they will break their bones and shatter their arrows.
israel is like a lion, curled up and lying down.
yes, they are like a young lion, and no one wants to wake him!
anyone who blesses you will be blessed.
and anyone who curses you will have great troubles.” 
when balak heard this, he angrily struck his fist against his hand and said to balaam, “i called you to come and curse my enemies.
but you have blessed them.
you have blessed them three times.
now leave and go home!
i told you that i would give you a very good payment, but the lord has caused you to lose your reward.” 
balaam said to balak, “you sent men to ask me to come.
don’t you remember what i told them?
i said, 
‘even if balak gives me his most beautiful house filled with silver and gold, i can still say only what the lord commands me to say.
i cannot do anything myself, good or bad.
i must say what the lord commands.’ 
now i am going back to my own people.
but i will give you this warning.
i will tell you what these israelites will do to you and your people in the future.” 
then balaam gave this message: “this message is from balaam son of beor.
i am speaking about things i see clearly.
i heard this message from god.
i learned what god most high taught me.
i saw what god all-powerful showed me.
i humbly tell what i clearly see.
“i see him coming, but not now.
i see him coming, but not soon.
a star will come from the family of jacob.
a new ruler will come from the israelites.
he will smash the heads of the moabites and crush the heads of all the sons of sheth.
israel will grow strong!
he will get the land of edom.
he will get the land of seir, his enemy.
“a new ruler will come from the family of jacob.
that ruler will destroy the people left alive in that city.” 
then balaam saw the amalekites and said this: “amalek is the strongest of all nations, but even amalek will be destroyed!” 
then balaam saw the kenites and said this: “you believe that your country is safe, like a bird’s nest high on a mountain.
but you kenites will be destroyed, just as the lord destroyed cain.
assyria will make you prisoners.” 
then balaam said this: “no one can live when god does this.
ships will come from cyprus.
they will defeat assyria and eber, but those ships will also be destroyed.” 
then balaam got up and went back home, and balak went his own way.
chapter 71.
lord, i depend on you for protection.
don’t let me be disappointed.
you always do what is right, so come and save me.
listen to me and save me.
be my rock, my place of safety.
be my fortress, and protect me!
you are my rock and my protection.
my god, save me from wicked people.
save me from cruel, evil people.
lord god, you are my hope.
i have trusted you since i was a young boy.
i depended on you even before i was born.
i relied on you even in my mother’s womb.
i have always prayed to you.
you are my source of strength, so i have been an example to others.
i am always singing about the wonderful things you do.
don’t throw me away just because i am old.
don’t leave me as i lose my strength.
my enemies make plans against me.
they have met together and are making plans to kill me.
they say, “go get him!
god has left him, so there is no one to help him.” 
god, don’t leave me!
my god, hurry and help me!
defeat my enemies.
destroy them completely!
they are trying to hurt me.
let them suffer shame and disgrace.
then i will always trust in you and praise you more and more.
i will tell people how good you are.
i will tell about all the times you saved me— too many times to count.
i will tell about your greatness, my lord god.
i will talk only about you and your goodness.
god, you have taught me since i was a young boy.
and to this day i have told people about the wonderful things you do.
now that i am old and my hair is gray, don’t leave me, god.
i must tell the next generation about your power and greatness.
god, your goodness reaches far above the skies.
you have done wonderful things.
god, there is no one like you.
you have let me see troubles and hard times, but you will give me new life; you will lift me up from this pit of death!
you will help me do even greater things.
you will comfort me again!
i will play the harp and praise you.
my god, i will sing about your faithfulness.
i will play songs on my lyre for the holy one of israel.
i will shout for joy, singing songs of praise to you for saving me.
my tongue will sing about your goodness all the time, because those who wanted to kill me have been defeated and disgraced.
chapter 23.
then job answered: 
“i am still complaining today.
i groan because god is still making me suffer.
i wish i knew where to find him.
i wish i knew how to go to where he lives.
i would present my case to him.
i would make my arguments to show that i am innocent.
he could give his response, and i would understand.
i would listen closely to what he says.
would god use his power against me?
no, he would listen to me!
since i am an honest man, he would let me tell my story.
then my judge would set me free!
“if i go to the east, god is not there.
if i go to the west, i still don’t see him.
when he is working in the north, i don’t see him.
when he turns to the south, i still don’t see him.
but god knows me.
he is testing me and will see that i am as pure as gold.
i have always lived the way god wants.
i have never stopped following him.
i always obey his commands.
i love the words from his mouth more than i love my food.
“but god never changes, and who can stand against him?
he does anything he wants.
he will do to me what he planned, and he has many other plans for me.
that is why i am terrified to stand before him.
just thinking about it makes me afraid.
the fear of god has made me lose my courage.
god all-powerful makes me afraid.
what has happened to me is like a dark cloud over my face.
but the darkness will not keep me quiet.
2 chronicles.
chapter 14.
when abijah died, they buried him in the city of david.
abijah’s son asa became the new king after him.
there was peace in the country for ten years in asa’s time.
asa did what the lord his god said was good and right.
he took away the altars of the foreigners and the high places.
he also smashed the memorial stones and cut down the asherah poles.
he commanded the people of judah to follow the lord, the god their ancestors had worshiped, and to obey his laws and commands.
he also removed all the high places and incense altars from all the towns in judah.
so the kingdom had peace when asa was king.
asa built strong cities in judah while there was peace in judah.
he had no war in these years because the lord gave him peace.
asa said to the people of judah, “let’s build these towns and make walls around them.
let’s make towers, gates, and bars in the gates.
let’s do this while we still live in this country.
this country is ours because we have followed the lord our god.
he has given us peace all around us.” so they built and had success.
asa had an army of 300,000 men from the tribe of judah and 280,000 men from the tribe of benjamin.
the men from judah carried large shields and spears.
the men from benjamin carried small shields and shot arrows from bows.
all of them were strong and brave soldiers.
then zerah from ethiopia came out against asa’s army.
he had 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots in his army.
his army went as far as the town of mareshah.
asa went out to fight against zerah.
asa’s army got ready for battle in the valley of zephathah at mareshah.
asa called out to the lord his god and said, “lord, only you can help weak people against those who are strong!
help us, lord our god!
we depend on you.
we fight against this large army in your name.
lord, you are our god!
don’t let anyone defeat you!” 
then the lord used asa’s army from judah to defeat the ethiopian army.
and the army ran away.
asa’s army chased the ethiopian army all the way to the town of gerar.
so many ethiopians were killed that they could not get together as an army to fight again.
they were crushed by the lord and his army.
asa and his army carried many valuable things away from the enemy.
asa and his army defeated all the towns near gerar.
the people living in those towns were afraid of the lord.
those towns had very many valuable things.
asa’s army took those valuable things away from those towns.
his army also attacked the camps where the shepherds lived and took many sheep and camels.
then they went back to jerusalem.
chapter 12.
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, you live among people who refuse to obey me.
they have eyes to see what i have done for them, but they don’t see those things.
they have ears to hear what i told them to do, but they don’t hear my commands, because they are a rebellious people.
so, son of man, pack some things as if you are leaving on a trip.
pretend that you are a prisoner being taken far away.
do this during the day so that everyone can see you.
even though these people refuse to listen to me, maybe when they see you going away, they will understand what i have been trying to tell them.
“during the day, take your bags outside so that the people can see you.
then in the evening, pretend you are going away.
act as if you are a prisoner going to a faraway country.
while the people are watching, make a hole in the wall and go out through that hole in the wall.
at night, put your bag on your shoulder and leave.
cover your face so that you cannot see where you are going.
you must do these things so that the people can see you, because i am using you as an example to the family of israel.” 
so i did as i was commanded.
during the day, i took my bags and acted as if i were going to a faraway country.
that evening, i used my hands and made a hole in the wall.
during the night, i put my bag on my shoulder and left.
i did this so that all the people could see me.
the next morning, the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, did the people of israel—those people who always refuse to obey—ask you what you were doing?
tell them that this is what the lord god said.
this sad message is about the leader of jerusalem and all the people of israel who live there.
tell them, ‘i am an example for all of you.
what i have done will happen to you.’ you will be forced to go to a faraway country as prisoners.
and your leader will make a hole in the wall and sneak out at night.
he will cover his face so that people will not recognize him.
his eyes will not be able to see where he is going.
he will try to escape, but i will catch him!
he will be caught in my trap.
then i will bring him to babylonia—the land of the chaldeans.
but he will not be able to see where he is going.
i will force the king’s people to live in the foreign countries around israel, and i will scatter his army to the winds.
the enemy soldiers will chase after them.
then they will know that i am the lord.
they will know that i scattered them among the nations.
they will know that i forced them to go to other countries.
“but i will let a few of the people live.
they will not die from the disease, hunger, and war.
i will let them live so that they can tell other people about the terrible things they did against me.
then they will know that i am the lord.” 
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, you must act as if you are very frightened.
you must shake when you eat your food.
you must act worried and afraid when you drink your water.
you must say this to the common people: ‘this is what the lord god says to the people living in jerusalem and in the other parts of israel.
you will be very worried while you eat your food.
you will be terrified while you drink your water, because everything in your country will be destroyed!
this will happen because the people living there are so violent.
many people live in your cities now, but those cities will be ruined.
your whole country will be destroyed!
then you will know that i am the lord.’” 
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, why do people quote this saying about the land of israel: ‘trouble will not come soon; what is seen in visions will not come’?
“tell the people that the lord god will end that saying.
they will not say that about israel anymore.
now they will quote this saying: ‘trouble will come soon; what is seen in visions will happen.’ 
“there will not be any more false visions in israel.
there will not be any more magicians telling things that don’t come true.
that’s because i am the lord, and if i say something will happen, it will happen!
i will not wait any longer.
those troubles are coming soon—in your own lifetime.
hear me, you people who always refuse to obey!
when i say something, i make it happen.” this is what the lord god said.
then the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, the people of israel think that the visions i give you are for a time far in the future.
they think you are talking about things that will happen many years from now.
so you must tell them this: ‘the lord god says, i will not delay any longer.
if i say something will happen, it will happen!’” this is what the lord god said.
2 kings.
chapter 17.
hoshea son of elah began to rule in samaria over israel.
this was during the 12th year that ahaz was king of judah.
hoshea ruled nine years.
he did what the lord said was wrong, but he was not as bad as the kings of israel who had ruled before him.
king shalmaneser of assyria came to fight against hoshea and defeated him.
so hoshea paid tribute to shalmaneser.
later, hoshea sent messengers to the king of egypt to ask for help.
that king’s name was so.
that year hoshea did not pay tribute to the king of assyria as he did every other year.
the king of assyria learned that hoshea had made plans against him.
so he arrested hoshea and put him in jail.
the king of assyria attacked many places in israel.
then he came to samaria and fought against it for three years.
the king of assyria took samaria during the ninth year that hoshea was king of israel.
he captured many israelites and took them as prisoners to assyria.
he made them live in halah by the habor river at gozan and in other cities of the medes.
these things happened because the israelites had sinned against the lord their god.
and it was the lord who brought the israelites out of the land of egypt!
he saved them from the power of pharaoh, the king of egypt.
but the israelites began worshiping other gods.
they began doing the same things that other people did.
and the lord had forced those people to leave their land when the israelites came.
the israelites also chose to be ruled by kings.
the israelites secretly did things against the lord their god, and those things were wrong!
the israelites built high places in all their cities—from the smallest town to the largest city.
they put up memorial stones and asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
they burned incense there in all those places for worship.
they did these things like the nations that the lord forced out of the land before them.
the israelites did evil things that made the lord angry.
they served idols, and the lord had said to them, “you must not do this.” 
the lord used every prophet and every seer to warn israel and judah.
he said, “turn away from the evil things you do.
obey my commands and laws.
follow all the law that i gave to your ancestors.
i used my servants the prophets to give this law to you.” 
but the people would not listen.
they were very stubborn like their ancestors.
their ancestors did not believe the lord their god.
they refused to follow his laws and the agreement he made with their ancestors.
they would not listen to his warnings.
they worshiped idols that were worth nothing and they themselves became worth nothing.
the lord had warned them not to do the evil things that the people in the nations around them did.
but they lived the same way those people lived.
the people stopped following the commands of the lord their god.
they made two gold statues of calves.
they made asherah poles.
they worshiped all the stars of heaven and served baal.
they sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire.
they used magic and witchcraft to try to learn the future.
they sold themselves to do what the lord said was evil.
they did this to make him angry.
so the lord became very angry with israel and removed them from his sight.
there were no israelites left, except the tribe of judah.
but even the people of judah did not obey the commands of the lord their god.
they lived just as the israelites had.
the lord rejected all the israelites.
he brought them many troubles.
he let people destroy them.
finally, he threw them away and removed them from his sight.
he tore them from the family of david, and they made jeroboam son of nebat their king.
jeroboam pulled the israelites away from following the lord.
he caused them to commit a great sin.
so the israelites sinned in all the ways jeroboam did.
and they did not stop committing these sins 
until the lord took israel away from his sight.
and he said this would happen.
he sent his prophets to tell the people this would happen.
so the israelites were taken out of their country into assyria.
and they have been there to this day.
the king of assyria took the israelites out of samaria and brought in other people from babylon, cuthah, avva, hamath, and sepharvaim.
they took over samaria and lived in the cities around it.
when these people began to live in samaria, they did not honor the lord, so the lord sent lions to attack them.
the lions killed some of them.
some people said to the king of assyria, “the people who you took away and put in the cities of samaria don’t know the law of the god of that country.
so that god sent lions to attack them.
the lions killed them because they don’t know the law of the god of that country.” 
so the king of assyria gave this command: “you took some priests from samaria.
send one of them who i captured back to samaria.
let that priest go and live there.
then he can teach the people the law of the god of that country.” 
so one of the priests who the assyrians had carried away from samaria came to live in bethel.
he taught the people how they should honor the lord.
but all those people made gods of their own.
they put them in the temples at the high places that the people of samaria had made.
they did this wherever they lived.
the people of babylon made the false god succoth benoth.
the people of cuthah made the false god nergal.
the people of hamath made the false god ashima.
the people of avva made the false gods nibhaz and tartak.
the people from sepharvaim also burned their children in the fire to honor their false gods, adrammelech and anammelech.
but they also worshiped the lord.
they chose priests for the high places from among the people.
these priests made sacrifices for the people in the temples at those places of worship.
they respected the lord but also served their own gods, just as they did in their own countries.
even today, they live the same way they did in the past.
they don’t honor the lord.
they don’t obey the rules and commands of the israelites.
they don’t obey the law or the commands that the lord gave to the children of jacob.
the lord made an agreement with the israelites.
he commanded them, “you must not honor other gods.
you must not worship them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them.
but you must follow the lord, who brought you out of egypt.
he used his great power to save you.
you must worship him and make sacrifices to him.
you must obey the rules, laws, teachings, and commands that he wrote for you.
you must obey these things all the time.
you must not respect other gods.
you must not forget the agreement that i made with you.
you must not respect other gods.
no, you must respect only the lord your god.
then he will save you from all your enemies.” 
but the israelites did not listen.
they kept on doing the same things they did before.
so now those other nations respected the lord, but they also served their own idols.
their children and grandchildren did the same thing their ancestors did.
they still do these things to this day.
chapter 117.
praise the lord, all you nations.
praise him, all you people.
he loves us very much!
the lord will be faithful to us forever!
praise the lord!
chapter 3.
jerusalem, your people fought against god.
they hurt other people, and you have been stained with sin.
they didn’t listen to me or accept my teachings.
jerusalem didn’t trust the lord.
jerusalem didn’t go to her god.
jerusalem’s leaders are like roaring lions.
her judges are like hungry wolves that come in the evening to attack the sheep—and in the morning nothing is left.
her prophets are always making secret plans to get more and more.
her priests have treated holy things as if they were not holy.
they have done bad things to god’s teachings.
but the lord is still in that city, and he continues to be good.
he does not do anything wrong.
he continues to help his people.
morning after morning he makes good decisions for them.
not a day passes without his justice.
he never gives a decision that is crooked or is something to be ashamed of.
the lord says, “i have destroyed whole nations and their defense towers.
i destroyed their streets and now no one goes there anymore.
their cities are empty—no one lives there anymore.
i tell you this so that you will learn a lesson.
i want you to fear and respect me.
if you do this, your home will not be destroyed, and i will not have to punish you the way i planned.” but those evil people only wanted to do more of the same evil things they had already done!
the lord said, “so just wait!
wait for me to stand and judge you.
i have the right to bring people from many nations and use them to punish you.
i will use them to show my anger against you.
i will use them to show how upset i am—and the whole country will be destroyed.
then i will change people from other nations so that they can speak the language clearly and call out the name of the lord.
they will all worship me together, shoulder to shoulder, as one people.
people will come all the way from the other side of the river in ethiopia.
my scattered people will come to me.
my worshipers will come and bring their gifts to me.
“then, jerusalem, you will no longer be ashamed of the wrong things your people do against me.
that is because i will remove all the bad people from jerusalem.
i will take away all the proud people.
there will not be any of them on my holy mountain.
i will let only meek and humble people stay in my city, and they will trust the lord’s name.
the survivors of israel will not do bad things or tell lies.
they will not try to trick people with lies.
they will be like sheep that eat and lie down in peace—and no one will bother them.” 
jerusalem, sing and be happy!
israel, shout for joy!
jerusalem, be happy and have fun!
the lord stopped your punishment.
he destroyed your enemies’ strong towers.
king of israel, the lord is with you.
you don’t need to worry about anything bad happening.
at that time jerusalem will be told, “be strong, don’t be afraid!
the lord your god is with you.
he is like a powerful soldier.
he will save you.
he will show how much he loves you and how happy he is with you.
he will laugh and be happy about you, 
like people at a party.
i will take away your shame.
i will make them stop hurting you.
at that time i will punish those who hurt you.
i will save my hurt people and bring back those who were forced to leave.
i will give them praise and honor everywhere, even in places where they suffered shame.
at that time i will lead you back home.
i will bring your people back together.
i will cause people everywhere to honor and praise you.
you will see me bring back all the blessings you once had.” this is what the lord said.

chapter 16.
“remember, in the month of abib you must celebrate passover to honor the lord your god.
it was that night in abib when the lord your god brought you out of egypt.
you must go to the place the lord your god will choose to be the home for his name.
there you must offer the passover sacrifice to honor the lord.
you must offer the cattle and goats.
don’t eat bread that has yeast in it with this sacrifice.
you must eat unleavened bread for seven days.
this bread is called ‘bread of trouble.’ it will help you remember the troubles you had in egypt.
remember how quickly you had to leave that country.
you must remember that day as long as you live.
there must be no yeast in anyone’s house anywhere in the country for seven days.
and all the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day must be eaten before morning.
“you must not sacrifice the passover animal in any of the towns that the lord your god gives you.
you must sacrifice the passover animal only at the place that the lord your god will choose to be the home for his name.
there you must sacrifice the passover animal in the evening when the sun goes down.
this is the festival when you remember that god brought you out of egypt.
you must cook the meal and eat it at the place the lord your god will choose.
the next morning you may go back home.
you must eat unleavened bread six days.
on the seventh day you must not do any work.
on this day the people will come together for a special meeting to honor the lord your god.
“you must count seven weeks from the time you begin to harvest the grain.
then celebrate the festival of harvest for the lord your god.
do this by bringing him some special gift you want to bring.
decide how much to give by thinking about how much the lord your god has blessed you.
go to the place the lord will choose to be the home for his name.
you and your people should enjoy yourselves together there with the lord your god.
take all your people with you—your sons, your daughters, and all your servants.
and take the levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows living in your towns.
remember, you were slaves in egypt.
so be sure to obey these laws.
“seven days after you have gathered your harvest in from your threshing floor and from your winepress, you should celebrate the festival of shelters.
enjoy yourselves at this festival—you, your sons, your daughters, all your servants, and the levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows living in your towns.
celebrate this festival for seven days at the special place the lord will choose.
do this to honor the lord your god.
the lord your god blessed your harvest and all the work you did, so be very happy!
“three times a year all your men must come to meet with the lord your god at the special place he will choose.
they must come for the festival of unleavened bread, the festival of harvest, and the festival of shelters.
everyone who comes to meet with the lord must bring a gift.
each man should give as much as he can.

every tribe must do this.
and these men must be fair in judging the people.
you must always be fair.
you must not favor some people over other people.
you must not take money to change your mind in judgment.

goodness and fairness!
you must try very hard to be good and fair all the time.
then you will live and keep the land that the lord your god is giving you.
“when you set up an altar for the lord your god, you must not place beside the altar any of the wooden poles that honor the goddess asherah.
you must not set up special stones for worshiping false gods.
the lord your god hates them.
chapter 9.
abimelech was the son of gideon.
abimelech went to his uncles who lived in the city of shechem.
he said to his uncles and all of his mother’s family, 
“ask the leaders of the city of shechem this question: ‘is it better for you to be ruled by the 70 sons of gideon or to be ruled by only one man?
remember, i am your relative.’” 
abimelech’s uncles spoke to the leaders of shechem and asked them that question.
the leaders of shechem decided to follow abimelech.
they said, “after all, he is our brother.” 
so the leaders of shechem gave abimelech 70 pieces of silver.
that silver was from the temple of the god baal berith.
abimelech used the silver to hire some men.
these men were worthless, reckless men.
they followed abimelech wherever he went.
abimelech went to his father’s house at ophrah and murdered his brothers.
he killed the 70 sons of his father gideon.
he killed them all at the same time, but gideon’s youngest son hid from abimelech and escaped.
the youngest son’s name was jotham.
then all the leaders in shechem and the house of millo came together.
everyone gathered beside the big tree of the pillar in shechem and made abimelech their king.
jotham heard that the leaders of the city of shechem had made abimelech king.
when he heard this, he went and stood on the top of mount gerizim and shouted out this story to the people: “listen to me you leaders of the city of shechem.
then let god listen to you.
“one day the trees decided to choose a king to rule over them.
the trees said to the olive tree, ‘you be king over us.’ 
“but the olive tree said, ‘my oil is used to honor gods and humans.
should i stop making my oil just to go and sway over the other trees?’ 
“then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘come and be our king.’ 
“but the fig tree answered, ‘should i stop making my good, sweet fruit just to go and sway over the other trees?’ 
“then the trees said to the vine, ‘come and be our king.’ 
“but the vine answered, ‘my wine makes men and kings happy.
should i stop making my wine just to go and sway over the trees?’ 
“finally, all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘come and be our king.’ 
“but the thornbush said to the trees, ‘if you really want to make me king over you, come and find shelter in my shade.
but if you don’t want to do this, let fire come out of the thornbush.
let the fire burn even the cedar trees of lebanon.’ 
“now if you were completely honest when you made abimelech king, may you be happy with him.
and if you have been fair to gideon and his family, and if you have treated him as you should, this is also good.
but remember what my father did for you.
he fought for you and risked his life when he saved you from the midianites.
but now you have turned against my father’s family.
you have killed 70 of his sons all at the same time.
you made abimelech the new king over the city of shechem.
he is only the son of my father’s slave girl.
but you made him king because he is your relative.
so if you have been completely honest to gideon and his family today, then may you be happy with abimelech as your king.
and may he be happy with you.
but leaders of shechem and the house of millo, if you have not acted right, may abimelech destroy you.
and may abimelech be destroyed too!” 
after jotham had said this, he ran away and escaped to the city named beer.
he stayed there because he was afraid of his brother abimelech.
abimelech ruled the israelites for three years.
abimelech had killed gideon’s 70 sons—and they were his own brothers.
the leaders of shechem had supported him in doing this evil thing.
so god caused trouble between abimelech and the leaders of shechem.
and they began planning ways to hurt abimelech.
the leaders of the city of shechem did not like abimelech anymore.
they put men on the hilltops to attack and rob everyone who went by.
abimelech found out about the attacks.
a man named gaal son of ebed and his brothers moved to the city of shechem.
the leaders of the city of shechem decided to trust and follow gaal.
one day the people of shechem went out to the vineyards to pick grapes.
they squeezed the grapes to make wine.
and then they had a party at the temple of their god.
the people ate and drank and cursed abimelech.
then gaal son of ebed said, “we are the men of shechem.
why should we obey abimelech?
who does he think he is?
abimelech is one of gideon’s sons, right?
and abimelech made zebul his officer, right?
we should not obey abimelech.
we should follow our own people, men from hamor.
(hamor was the father of shechem.)
if you make me the commander of these people, i will destroy abimelech.
i will say to him, ‘get your army ready and come out to battle.’” 
zebul was the governor of the city of shechem.
zebul heard what gaal son of ebed said, and he became very angry.
zebul sent messengers to abimelech in the city of arumah.
this is the message: “gaal son of ebed and gaal’s brothers have come to the city of shechem.
they are making trouble for you.
gaal is turning the whole city against you.
so now you and your men should come tonight and hide in the fields outside the city.
when the sun comes up in the morning, attack the city.
gaal and his men will come out of the city to fight you.
when they come out to fight, do what you can to them.” 
so abimelech and all his soldiers got up during the night and went to the city.
the soldiers separated into four groups.
they hid near the city of shechem.
gaal son of ebed went out and was standing at the entrance to the gate of the city of shechem.
while gaal was standing there, abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places.
when gaal saw the soldiers, he said to zebul, “look, there are people coming down from the mountains.” but zebul said, “you are only seeing the shadows of the mountains.
the shadows just look like people.” 
but again gaal said, “look, there are some people coming down from that place over there by land’s navel.
and there!
i saw someone’s head over by magician’s tree.” 
zebul said to gaal, “why aren’t you bragging now?
you said, ‘who is abimelech?
why should we obey him?’ you made fun of these men.
now go out and fight them.” 
so gaal led the leaders of shechem out to fight abimelech.
abimelech and his men chased gaal and his men.
gaal’s men ran back toward the gate of the city of shechem, but many were killed before they could get back to the gate.
then abimelech returned to the city of arumah.
zebul forced gaal and his brothers to leave the city of shechem.
the next day the people of shechem went out to the fields to work.
abimelech found out about it.
so abimelech separated his men into three groups.
he wanted to attack the people of shechem by surprise.
so he hid his men in the fields.
when he saw the people coming out of the city, he jumped up and attacked them.
abimelech and his group ran to a place near the gate to shechem.
the other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and killed them.
abimelech and his men fought against the city of shechem all that day.
they captured the city of shechem and killed its people.
then abimelech tore down the city and threw salt over the ruins.
there were some people who lived at the tower of shechem.
when they heard what had happened to shechem, they gathered together in the safest room of the temple of the god el berith.
abimelech heard that all the leaders of the tower of shechem had gathered together.
so abimelech and all his men went up to mount zalmon.
abimelech took an ax and cut off some branches and carried them on his shoulders.
then abimelech said to the men with him, “hurry!
do the same thing that i have done.” 
so all the men cut branches and followed abimelech.
they piled the branches against the safest room of the temple of the god el berith.
then they set the branches on fire and burned the people in the room.
about 1000 men and women living near the tower of shechem died.
then abimelech and his men went to the city of thebez and captured that city.
but inside the city there was a strong tower, so all the leaders and other men and women of that city ran to the tower.
when the people were inside the tower, they locked the door behind them.
then they climbed up to the roof of the tower.
abimelech and his men came to the tower to attack it.
abimelech went up to the door of the tower to burn it.
but, while abimelech was standing at the door of the tower, a woman on the roof dropped a grinding stone on his head.
the grinding stone crushed his skull.
abimelech quickly said to the servant who carried his weapons, “take out your sword and kill me.
i want you to kill me so that people will not say, ‘a woman killed abimelech.’” so the servant stabbed abimelech with his sword, and he died.
the israelites saw that abimelech was dead, so they all went back home.
in that way god punished abimelech for all the bad things he had done.
abimelech sinned against his own father by killing his 70 brothers.
god also punished the men of the city of shechem for the bad things they had done.
so the things said by jotham son of gideon came true.
chapter 7.
i am upset because i am like fruit that has been gathered, like grapes that have already been picked.
there are no grapes left to eat.
there are none of the early figs that i love.
by this i mean that all the faithful people are gone.
there are no good people left.
everyone is planning to kill someone.
everyone is trying to trap their brother.
people are good at doing bad things with both hands.
officials ask for bribes.
judges take money to change their decisions in court.
“important leaders” do whatever they want to do.
even the best of them is as crooked as a tangled thornbush.
your prophets said this day would come, and the day of your watchmen has come.
now you will be punished.
now you will be confused!
don’t trust your neighbor or trust a friend!
don’t even speak freely with your wife.
your enemies will be the people in your own house.
a son will not honor his father.
a daughter will turn against her mother.
a daughter-in-law will turn against her mother-in-law.
so i will look to the lord for help.
i will wait for god to save me.
my god will hear me.
i have fallen, but enemy, don’t laugh at me!
i will get up again.
i sit in darkness now, but the lord will be a light for me.
i sinned against the lord, so he was angry with me.
but he will argue my case for me in court.
he will do what is right for me.
then he will bring me out into the light, and i will see that he is right.
my enemy said to me, “where is the lord your god?” but my enemy will see this, and she will be ashamed.
at that time i will laugh at her.
people will walk over her, like mud in the streets.
the time will come when your walls will be rebuilt.
at that time the country will grow.
your people will come back to your land.
they will come back from assyria and from the cities of egypt.
they will come from egypt and from the other side of the euphrates river.
they will come from the sea in the west and from the mountains in the east.
the land was ruined by the people who lived there and by what they did.
so rule your people with your rod.
rule the flock of people who belong to you.
that flock lives alone in the woods and up on mount carmel.
that flock lives in bashan and gilead as they did in the past.
i did many miracles when i took you out of egypt.
i will let you see more miracles like that.
the nations will see those miracles, and they will be ashamed.
they will see that their “power” is nothing compared to mine.
they will be amazed and put their hands over their mouths.
they will cover their ears and refuse to listen.
they will crawl in the dust like a snake.
they will shake with fear.
they will be like insects crawling from their holes in the ground and coming to the lord our god.
god, they will fear and respect you!
there is no god like you.
you take away people’s guilt.
god will forgive his people who survive.
he will not stay angry with them forever, because he enjoys being kind.
he will come back and comfort us again.
he will throw all our sins into the deep sea.
god, please be true to jacob.
be kind and loyal to abraham, as you promised our ancestors long ago.

chapter 9.
so solomon finished building the lord’s temple and his own palace.
solomon built everything that he wanted to build.
then the lord appeared to solomon again, just as he did at gibeon.
the lord said to him, “i heard your prayer and what you asked me to do.
you built this temple, and i have made it a holy place.
so i will be honored there forever.
i will watch over it and think of it always.
you must serve me with a pure and honest heart, just as your father david did.
you must obey my laws and do everything that i commanded you.
if you do, i will make sure that your family will always rule israel, just as i promised your father david when i told him that israel would always be ruled by one of his descendants.
“but if you or your children stop following me, and don’t obey the laws and commands that i have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods, i will force israel to leave the land that i have given to them.
israel will be an example to other people.
other people will make jokes about israel.
i made the temple holy.
it is the place where people honor me.
but i will tear it down.
this temple will be destroyed.
everyone who sees it will be amazed.
they will ask, ‘why did the lord do this terrible thing to this land and to this temple?’ 
people will say, ‘this happened because they left the lord their god.
he brought their ancestors out of egypt, but they decided to follow other gods.
they worshiped and served those gods.
that is why the lord caused all these bad things to happen to them.’” 
it took 20 years for king solomon to build the lord’s temple and the king’s palace.
hiram supplied solomon with all the cedar, pine and gold that he wanted, so solomon gave him 20 cities in galilee.
so hiram traveled from tyre to see the cities that solomon had given him.
but hiram was not pleased when he saw them.
king hiram said, “what are these towns that you have given me, my brother?” king hiram named that land the land of cabul.
and that area is still called cabul today.
hiram had sent king solomon about 9000 pounds of gold to use in building the temple.
king solomon forced slaves to work for him to build the temple and his palace.
then he used these slaves to build many other things.
he built the millo and the city wall around jerusalem.
then he rebuilt the cities of hazor, megiddo, and gezer.
in the past the king of egypt had fought against the city of gezer and burned it.
he killed the canaanites who lived there.
when solomon married pharaoh’s daughter, pharaoh gave him that city as a wedding present.
solomon rebuilt gezer and the city of lower beth horon.
he also built the cities of baalath and tamar in the judean desert.
he also built cities where he could store grain, and he built places for his chariots and his horses.
king solomon also built whatever he wanted in jerusalem, lebanon, and all the places he ruled.
there were people left in the land who were not israelites.
there were amorites, hittites, perizzites, hivites, and jebusites.
the israelites had not been able to destroy them, but solomon forced them to work for him as slaves.
they are still slaves today.
solomon did not force any israelites to be his slaves.
the israelites were soldiers, government officials, officers, captains, and chariot commanders and drivers.
there were 550 supervisors over solomon’s projects.
they supervised the men who did the work.
pharaoh’s daughter moved from the city of david to the palace that solomon had built for her.
then he built the millo.
three times each year solomon offered burned sacrifices and fellowship offerings on the altar that he built for the lord.
king solomon also burned incense before the lord and supplied what was needed for the temple.
king solomon also built ships at ezion geber.
this town is near elath on the shore of the red sea, in the land of edom.
king hiram had some skilled sailors who knew the sea well.
he sent them to serve in solomon’s navy and work with solomon’s men.
solomon’s ships went to ophir and brought back about 16 tons of gold for him.
chapter 23.
sarah lived to be 127 years old.
she died in the city of kiriath arba (hebron) in the land of canaan.
abraham was very sad and cried for her there.
then he left his dead wife and went to talk to the hittites.
he said, 
“i am only a foreigner staying in your country.
i have no place to bury my wife.
please give me some land so that i can bury her.” 
the hittites answered abraham, 
“sir, you are a great leader among us.
you can have the best place we have to bury your dead.
you can have any of our burying places that you want.
none of us will stop you from burying your wife there.” 
abraham got up and bowed to the people.
he said to them, “if you really want to help me bury my dead wife, speak to ephron the son of zohar for me.
i would like to buy the cave of machpelah, which belongs to ephron.
it is at the end of his field.
i will pay him the full price.
i want all of you to be witnesses that i am buying it as a burial place.” 
ephron was sitting there among the people.
he answered abraham, 
“no, sir.
here in front of my people, i give you that land and the cave on it so that you can bury your wife.” 
abraham bowed before the hittites.
he said to ephron before all the people, “but i want to give you the full price for the field.
accept my money, and i will bury my dead.” 
ephron answered abraham, 
“sir, listen to me.
ten pounds of silver mean nothing to you or me.
take the land and bury your dead wife.” 
abraham understood that ephron was telling him the price of the land.
so abraham paid him for the land.
he weighed out ten pounds of silver for ephron and gave it to the merchant.
so the field of ephron changed owners.
this field was in machpelah, near mamre.
abraham became the owner of the field, the cave in it, and all the trees in the field.
everyone in the city saw the agreement between ephron and abraham.
after this, abraham buried his wife sarah in the cave of that field near mamre (hebron) in the land of canaan.
abraham bought the field and the cave in it from the hittites.
so this became his property to be used as a burial place.
2 chronicles.
chapter 28.
ahaz was 20 years old when he became king.
he ruled 16 years in jerusalem.
he did not live right, as david his ancestor had done.
ahaz did not do what the lord wanted him to do.
he followed the bad example of the kings of israel.
he used molds to make idols to worship the baal gods.
he burned incense in the valley of ben hinnom and sacrificed his own sons by burning them in the fire.
he did the same terrible sins that the peoples living in that land did.
the lord had forced them out when the israelites entered that land.
ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
because ahaz did these things, the lord his god let the king of aram defeat him.
the king and his army defeated ahaz and took many people of judah as prisoners to the city of damascus.
ahaz also suffered a terrible defeat by the king of israel, pekah son of remaliah.
pekah and his army killed 120,000 of the bravest soldiers in judah in one day.
all this happened because the people of judah had turned away from the lord, the god their ancestors worshiped.
zicri was a brave soldier from ephraim.
he killed the king’s son maaseiah.
he also killed azrikam, the officer in charge of the king’s palace, and elkanah, who was second in command to the king.
the israelite army captured 200,000 of their own relatives living in judah.
they took women, children, and many valuable things from judah and carried them back to samaria.
but one of the lord’s prophets named oded was there.
oded met the israelite army that came back to samaria.
he said to the israelite army, “the lord, the god your ancestors worshiped, let you defeat the people of judah because he was angry with them.
but now he is angry with you, because he has seen how cruel you were in killing them.
and now you plan to keep the people of judah and jerusalem as slaves.
but you are as guilty as they are for sinning against the lord your god.
now listen to me.
send back all those you captured, your own brothers and sisters, because the lord’s terrible anger is against you.” 
then some of the leaders in ephraim saw the israelite soldiers coming home from war.
they met the israelite soldiers and warned them.
the leaders were azariah son of jehohanan, berekiah son of meshillemoth, jehizkiah son of shallum, and amasa son of hadlai.
they said to the israelite soldiers, “don’t bring the prisoners from judah here.
if you do that, it will add to our sin against the lord.
it will make our sin and guilt before him even worse than it is now, and he is already very angry with israel!” 
so the soldiers gave the prisoners and valuable things to the leaders and to the people.
the leaders (azariah, berekiah, jehizkiah, and amasa) stood up and helped the prisoners.
these four men got the clothes that the israelite army took and gave them to the people who were naked.
the leaders also gave them sandals.
they gave the prisoners from judah something to eat and drink.
they rubbed oil on them to soften and heal their wounds.
then the leaders from ephraim put the weak prisoners on donkeys and took them back home to their families in jericho, the city of palm trees.
then the four leaders went back home to samaria.
at that same time the people from edom came again and defeated the people of judah.
the edomites captured people and took them away as prisoners.
so king ahaz asked the king of assyria to help him.
the philistines also attacked the towns in the hills and in south judah.
the philistines captured the towns of beth shemesh, aijalon, gederoth, soco, timnah, and gimzo.
they also captured the villages near these towns.
then the philistines lived in them.
the lord gave troubles to judah because king ahaz of judah encouraged the people of judah to sin.
he was very unfaithful to the lord.
king tiglath pileser of assyria came and gave ahaz trouble instead of helping him.
ahaz took some valuable things from the lord’s temple and from the king’s palace and from the prince’s house.
ahaz gave them to the king of assyria, but that didn’t help him.
in ahaz’s troubles, he sinned worse and became more unfaithful to the lord.
he offered sacrifices to the gods the people of damascus worshiped.
the people of damascus had defeated ahaz.
so he thought to himself, “the gods the people of aram worship helped them.
so if i offer sacrifices to them, maybe they will help me also.” ahaz worshiped these gods.
in this way he sinned, and he made the people of israel sin.
ahaz gathered the things from god’s temple and broke them to pieces.
then he closed the doors of the lord’s temple.
he made altars and put them on every street corner in jerusalem.
in every town in judah ahaz made high places for burning incense to worship other gods.
ahaz made the lord, the god his ancestors obeyed, very angry.
everything else ahaz did, from the beginning to the end, is written in the book, the history of the kings of judah and israel.
ahaz died and was buried with his ancestors.
the people buried him in the city of jerusalem.
but they didn’t bury him in the same burial place where the kings of israel were buried.
ahaz’s son hezekiah became the new king in his place.
chapter 3.
my son, don’t forget my teaching.
remember what i tell you to do.
what i teach will give you a good, long life, and all will go well for you.
don’t ever let love and loyalty leave you.
tie them around your neck, and write them on your heart.
then god will be pleased and think well of you and so will everyone else.
trust the lord completely, and don’t depend on your own knowledge.
with every step you take, think about what he wants, and he will help you go the right way.
don’t trust in your own wisdom, but fear and respect the lord and stay away from evil.
if you do this, it will be like a refreshing drink and medicine for your body.
honor the lord with your wealth and the first part of your harvest.
then your barns will be full of grain, and your barrels will be overflowing with wine.
my son, don’t reject the lord’s discipline, and don’t be angry when he corrects you.
the lord corrects the one he loves, just as a father corrects a child he cares about.
those who find wisdom are fortunate; they will be blessed when they gain understanding.
profit that comes from wisdom is better than silver and even the finest gold.
wisdom is worth more than fine jewels.
nothing you desire has more value.
with her right hand, wisdom offers long life—with the other hand, riches and honor.
wisdom will lead you to a life of joy and peace.
wisdom is like a life-giving tree to those who hold on to her; she is a blessing to those who keep her close.
with wisdom and understanding, the lord created the earth and sky.
with his knowledge, he made the oceans and the clouds that produce rain.
my son, don’t ever let wisdom out of your sight.
hold on to wisdom and careful planning.
they will bring you a long life filled with honor.
as you go through life, you will always be safe and never fall.
when you lie down, you will not be afraid.
when you rest, your sleep will be peaceful.
you have no reason to fear a sudden disaster or the destruction that comes to the wicked.
you can trust the lord to protect you.
he will not let you fall into harm.
do everything you possibly can for those who need help.
if your neighbor needs something you have, don’t say, “come back tomorrow.” give it to him immediately.
don’t make plans to harm your neighbor, who lives near you and trusts you.
don’t take people to court without good reason, especially when they have done nothing to harm you.
don’t envy those who are violent.
never choose to be like them.
such crooked people are disgusting to the lord.
but he is a friend to those who are good and honest.
the lord curses a wicked family, but he blesses the homes of those who live right.
he will humiliate those who make fun of others, but he is kind to those who are humble.
the way the wise live will bring them honor, but the way fools live will bring them shame.
chapter 5.
the lord said to moses, 
“tell the people to send away from the camp anyone who is unclean, that is, anyone who has a serious skin disease or discharge and anyone who has touched a dead body.
whether they are a man or a woman, send them away so that the camp where i am living among you will not be made unclean.” 
so the israelites obeyed god’s command.
they sent those people outside the camp.
they did what the lord had told moses.
the lord said to moses, 
“tell this to the israelites: you might do something wrong to another person.
when you do that, you are really sinning against god.
so you are guilty of doing wrong.
you must confess that sin.
then you must fully pay for that wrong thing you did.
you must add one-fifth to the payment and give it all to the person you had done wrong to.
but maybe the person is dead and does not have any close relatives to accept the payment.
in that case, you will give the payment to the lord.
that is, you will give the full payment to the priest.
the priest must sacrifice the ram that makes people pure.
this ram will be sacrificed to cover over your sins, but the priest will keep the rest of the payment.
“if any of you israelites gives a special gift to god, the priest who accepts that gift can keep it.
it is his.
you don’t have to give these special gifts, but if you do, the gifts belong to the priest.” 
then the lord said to moses, 
“tell the israelites this: a man’s wife might be unfaithful to him.
she might have sexual relations with another man and hide this from her husband.
and there might not be anyone to tell him that his wife committed this sin.
her husband might never know about the wrong thing she did, and she might not tell her husband about her sin.
but the husband might begin to think that his wife sinned against him, whether she has or not.
he might become jealous.
he might begin to believe that she is not pure and true to him.
if that happens, he must take his wife to the priest.
the husband must also take an offering of 8 cups of barley flour.
he must not pour oil or incense on the barley flour.
this barley flour is a grain offering to the lord that is given because the husband is jealous.
this offering will show that he thinks his wife has been unfaithful to him.
“the priest will take the woman before the lord and make her stand there.
then he will take some special water and put it in a clay jar.
he will put some dirt from the floor of the holy tent into the water.
he will force the woman to stand before the lord.
then he will loosen her hair and put the grain offering in her hand.
this is the barley flour that her husband gave because he was jealous.
at the same time, he will hold the clay jar of special water.
this is the special water that can bring trouble to the woman.
“then the priest will make the woman promise to tell the truth and say to her: ‘if you have not slept with another man, and if you have not sinned against your husband while you were married to him, then this water that causes trouble will not hurt you.
but if you have sinned against your husband—if you had sexual relations with a man who is not your husband—then you are not pure.
if that is true, you will have much trouble when you drink this special water.
you will not be able to have any children.
and if you are pregnant now, your baby will die.
and the lord will cause your people to speak evil of you and curse you.’ “then the priest must tell the woman to make an oath.
she must agree for the lord to cause these things to happen to her if she lies.
the priest must say, ‘you must drink this water that causes trouble.
if you have sinned, you will not be able to have children.
any baby you have will die before it is born.’ and the woman should say, ‘i agree to do as you say.’ 
“the priest should write these warnings on a scroll.
then he should wash the words off into the water.
then the woman must drink the water that brings trouble.
this water will enter her and, if she is guilty, it will cause her much suffering.
“then the priest will take the grain offering from her (the offering for jealousy) and raise it before the lord.
then he will carry it to the altar.
the priest will fill his hands with some of the grain and put it on the altar and let it burn there.
after that he will tell the woman to drink the water.
if the woman has sinned against her husband, the water will bring her trouble.
the water will go into her body and cause her much suffering.
any baby that is in her will die before it is born, and she will never be able to have children.
all the people will turn against her.
but if the woman has not sinned against her husband and she is pure, the priest will say that she is not guilty.
then she will be normal and able to have children.
“so this is the law about jealousy.
this is what you should do when a woman sins against her husband while she is married to him.
or if the man becomes jealous and thinks his wife has sinned against him, this is what the man should do.
the priest must tell her to stand before the lord.
then the priest will do all these things.
this is the law.
the husband will not be guilty of doing anything wrong, but the woman will suffer if she has sinned.” 
isaiah.
chapter 35.
the dry desert will rejoice.
the desert will be glad and blossom.
it will be covered with flowers and dance with joy.
it will be as beautiful as the forest of lebanon, the hill of carmel, and the sharon valley.
this will happen because all people will see the glory of the lord.
they will see the beauty of our god.
make the weak arms strong again.
strengthen the weak knees.
people are afraid and confused.
say to them, “be strong!
don’t be afraid!” look, your god will come and punish your enemies.
he will come and give you your reward.
he will save you.
then the eyes of the blind will be opened so that they can see, and the ears of the deaf will be opened so that they can hear.
crippled people will dance like deer, and those who cannot speak now will use their voices to sing happy songs.
this will happen when springs of water begin to flow in the dry desert.
now people see mirages that look like water, but then there will be real pools of water.
there will be wells in the dry land where water flows from the ground.
tall water plants will grow where wild animals once ruled.
there will be a road there.
this highway will be called “the holy road.” evil people will not be allowed to walk on that road.
no fools will walk on it.
only good people will walk there.
there will be no dangers on that road.
there will be no lions there to hurt people or any dangerous animals on it.
that road will be for the people god saves.
the lord will make his people free, and they will come back to him.
they will come into zion rejoicing.
they will be happy forever.
their happiness will be like a crown on their heads.
gladness and joy will fill them completely.
sorrow and sadness will be far, far away.
chapter 6.
so king darius gave an order to search the writings of the kings before him.
the writings were kept in babylon in the same place the money was kept.
a scroll was found in the fortress of ecbatana.
(ecbatana is in the province of media.)
this is what was written on that scroll: official note: 
during the first year that cyrus was king, he gave an order about the temple of god in jerusalem.
the order said: let the temple of god be rebuilt.
it will be a place to offer sacrifices.
let its foundations be built.
the temple must be 60 cubits high and 60 cubits wide.
its wall will be in layers that have three rows of large stones and one row of wooden timbers.
the cost of building the temple must be paid for from the king’s treasury.
also, the gold and silver things from god’s temple must be put back in their places.
nebuchadnezzar took them from the temple in jerusalem and brought them to babylon.
they must be put back in god’s temple.
so king darius sent this message to his officials: to tattenai, governor of the area west of the euphrates river, to shethar bozenai, and to all the officials living in that province.
i order you to stay away from jerusalem.
don’t bother the workers.
don’t try to stop the work on this temple of god.
let the jewish governor and the jewish leaders rebuild it.
let them rebuild god’s temple in the same place it was in the past.
now i give this order.
you must do this for the jewish leaders building god’s temple: the cost of the building must be fully paid from the king’s treasury.
the money will come from the taxes collected from the provinces in the area west of the euphrates river.
do these things quickly, so the work will not stop.
give them anything they need.
if they need young bulls, rams, or male lambs for sacrifices to the god of heaven, give these things to them.
if the priests of jerusalem ask for wheat, salt, wine, and oil, give these things to them every day without fail.
give them to the jewish priests so that they may offer sacrifices that please the god of heaven.
give these things so that the priests may pray for me and my sons.
also, i give this order: if anyone changes this order, a wooden beam must be pulled from their house and pushed through their body.
then their house must be destroyed until it is only a pile of rocks.
god put his name there in jerusalem.
may god defeat any king or other person who tries to change this order.
if anyone tries to destroy this temple in jerusalem, may god destroy that person.
i, darius, have ordered it.
this order must be obeyed quickly and completely.
so tattenai the governor of the area west of the euphrates river, shethar bozenai, and the men with them obeyed king darius’ order.
they obeyed the order quickly and completely.
so the jewish leaders continued to build.
encouraged by the preaching of haggai the prophet and zechariah son of iddo, they had great success.
they finished building the temple as the god of israel had commanded and as cyrus, darius, and artaxerxes, the kings of persia, had ordered.
the temple was finished on the third day of the month of adar.
that was in the sixth year of the rule of king darius.
then the israelites celebrated the dedication of god’s temple with much happiness.
the priests, the levites, and all the other people who came back from captivity joined in the celebration.
this is the way they dedicated god’s temple: they offered 100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 male lambs.
and they offered twelve male goats for all israel for a sin offering.
that is one goat for each of the twelve tribes of israel.
then they chose the priests in their groups and the levites in their groups to serve in god’s temple in jerusalem.
they did these things as it is written in the book of moses.
on the fourteenth day of the first month, the jews who came back from captivity celebrated the passover.
the priests and levites made themselves pure.
they all made themselves clean and ready to celebrate the passover.
the levites killed the passover lamb for all the jews who came back from captivity.
they did that for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.
so all the israelites who came back from captivity ate the passover meal.
other people washed themselves and made themselves pure from the unclean things of the people living in that country.
these pure people also shared in the passover meal.
they did this so that they could go to the lord, the god of israel, for help.
they celebrated the festival of unleavened bread with much joy for seven days.
the lord made them very happy because he had changed the attitude of the king of assyria.
so the king of assyria had helped them do the work on god’s temple.
chapter 6.
again the israelites did what the lord said was wrong.
so for seven years the lord allowed the midianites to defeat the israelites.
the midianites were very powerful and were cruel to the israelites.
so the israelites made many hiding places in the mountains.
they hid their food in caves and places that were hard to find.
they did that because the midianites and amalekites from the east always came and destroyed their crops.
they camped in the land and destroyed the crops that the israelites had planted.
they ruined the crops of the israelites as far as the land near the city of gaza.
they did not leave anything for the israelites to eat.
they did not even leave them any sheep, cattle, or donkeys.
the midianites came with their families, animals, and tents.
they were like a swarm of locusts!
they and their camels were too many to count.
they came into the land and ruined it.
the israelites became very poor because of the midianites.
so the israelites cried to the lord for help.
the midianites did all these bad things, so the israelites cried to the lord for help.
the lord sent a prophet to them.
he said, “this is what the lord, the god of israel, says: ‘you were slaves in the land of egypt.
i made you free and brought you out of that land.
i saved you from the powerful egyptians.
then the canaanites hurt you, so i saved you again.
i made them leave their land.
and i gave their land to you.’ 
then i said to you, ‘i am the lord your god.
you will live in the land of the amorites, but you must not worship their false gods.’ but you did not obey me.” 
one time the angel of the lord came to a place called ophrah and sat under an oak tree.
this oak tree belonged to a man named joash from the abiezer family.
his son gideon was beating some wheat in a winepress.
he was hiding so that the midianites could not see the wheat.
the angel of the lord appeared to gideon and said, “the lord be with you, brave soldier.” 
then gideon said, “pardon me, sir, but if the lord is with us, why are we having so many troubles?
we heard that he did wonderful things for our ancestors.
they tell us that the lord took them out of egypt.
but now it seems the lord has left us and is letting the midianites defeat us.” 
the lord turned toward gideon and said, “then use your great power and go save the israelites from the midianites.
i am sending you to save them.” 
but gideon answered and said, “pardon me, sir.
how can i save israel?
my family group is the weakest in the tribe of manasseh, and i am the youngest one in my family.” 
the lord answered gideon and said, “i will be with you, so you can defeat the midianites as easily as if they were only one man.” 
then gideon said to him, “if you would, please give me some proof that you really are the lord.
please wait here.
don’t go away until i come back to you.
let me bring my offering and set it down in front of you.” and the lord said, “i will wait until you come back.” 
so gideon went in and cooked a young goat in boiling water.
he also took about 20 pounds of flour and made bread without yeast.
then he put the meat into a basket and the broth from the meat into a pot.
he brought out the meat, the broth, and the bread without yeast and gave them to the lord under the oak tree.
the angel of god said to gideon, “put the meat and the bread on that rock over there.
then pour the broth on it.” gideon did as he was told.
the angel of the lord had a walking stick in his hand.
he touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick, and fire jumped up out of the rock and burned up the meat and the bread.
then the angel of the lord disappeared.
then gideon realized that he had been talking to the angel of the lord.
so he shouted, “oh, lord god!
i have seen the angel of the lord face to face!” 
but the lord said to gideon, “calm down!
don’t be afraid!
you will not die!” 
so gideon built an altar there to worship the lord and named it “the lord is peace.” it still stands in the city of ophrah, where the abiezer family lives.
that same night the lord said to gideon, “choose your father’s best bull, the one that is seven years old.
first, use it to pull down the altar your father built to worship baal.
also, cut down the asherah pole beside the altar.
then build the right kind of altar for the lord your god.
build it on this high ground.
then kill and burn the bull on this altar.
use the wood from the asherah pole to burn your offering.” 
so gideon took ten of his servants and did what the lord had told him to do.
but gideon was afraid that his family and the men of the city might see what he was doing, so he did it all at night, not in the daytime.
the men of the city got up the next morning and saw that the altar for baal had been destroyed!
they also saw that the asherah pole had been cut down.
it had been sitting next to the altar for baal.
they also saw the altar that gideon had built.
and they saw the bull that had been sacrificed on that altar.
the men of the city looked at each other and asked, “who pulled down our altar?
who cut down our asherah pole?
who sacrificed this bull on this new altar?” they asked many questions and tried to learn who did this.
someone told them, “gideon son of joash did this.” 
so the men of the city came to joash and said, “you must bring your son out.
he pulled down the altar for baal, and he cut down the asherah pole that was beside it.
so your son must die.” 
then joash spoke to the crowd that was standing around him.
joash said, “are you going to take baal’s side?
are you going to rescue baal?
if anyone takes baal’s side, let him be put to death by morning.
if baal really is a god, let him defend himself when someone pulls down his altar.” 
joash said, “if gideon pulled baal’s altar down, let baal argue with him.” on that day joash gave gideon a new name.
he called him jerub-baal.
the midianites, amalekites, and other people from the east joined together to fight against the israelites.
they went across the jordan river and camped in the jezreel valley.
the spirit of the lord filled gideon.
so gideon blew a trumpet to call the family of abiezer to follow him.
he sent messengers to all the people of the tribe of manasseh and told them to get their weapons and prepare for battle.
gideon also sent messengers to the tribes of asher, zebulun, and naphtali.
the messengers took the same message to them.
so they also went up to meet gideon and his men.
then gideon said to god, “you said that you would help me save the israelites.
give me proof.
i will put a sheepskin on the threshing floor.
if there is dew only on the sheepskin, while all the ground is dry, i will know that you will use me to save israel, as you said.” 
and that is exactly what happened.
gideon got up early the next morning and squeezed the sheepskin.
he was able to drain a bowl full of water from it.
then gideon said to god, “don’t be angry with me.
let me ask just one more thing.
let me test you one more time with the sheepskin.
this time let the sheepskin be dry, while the ground around it gets wet with dew.” 
that night god did that very thing.
just the sheepskin was dry, but the ground around it was wet with dew.
chapter 1.
when jacob (israel) went to egypt, his sons and their families went with him.
here are the names of those sons: 
reuben, simeon, levi, judah, 
issachar, zebulun, benjamin, 
dan, naphtali, gad, and asher.
another son, joseph, was already in egypt.
so jacob’s whole family was with him in egypt—70 descendants in all.
later, joseph, his brothers, and all the people of that generation died.
but the israelites had many children, and their number grew until the country of egypt was filled with them.
then a new king began to rule egypt.
he did not know joseph.
this king said to his people, “look at the israelites.
there are too many of them, and they are stronger than we are!
we must make plans to stop them from growing stronger.
if there is a war, they might join our enemies, defeat us, and escape from the land!” 
the egyptians decided to make life hard for the israelites, so they put slave masters over the people.
these masters forced the israelites to build the cities of pithom and rameses for the king.
the king used these cities to store grain and other things.
the egyptians forced the israelites to work harder and harder.
but the harder they worked, the more they grew and spread, and the more the egyptians became afraid of them.
so the egyptians made them work even harder.
they made life hard for the israelites.
they forced the israelites to work hard at making bricks and mortar and to work hard in the fields.
the egyptians showed no mercy in all the hard work they made the israelites do!
there were two hebrew nurses who helped the israelite women give birth.
they were named shiphrah and puah.
the king of egypt said to the nurses, 
“you will continue to help the hebrew women give birth to their children.
if a girl baby is born, let the baby live.
but if the baby is a boy, you must kill him!” 
but the nurses trusted god, so they did not obey the king’s command.
they let all the baby boys live.
the king of egypt called for the nurses and asked them, “why did you do this?
why did you let the baby boys live?” 
the nurses said to the king, “the hebrew women are much stronger than the egyptian women.
they give birth to their babies before we can go to help them.” 
the nurses trusted god, so he was good to them and allowed them to have their own families.
the hebrews continued to have more children, and they became very strong.
so pharaoh gave this command to his own people: “if the hebrew women give birth to a baby girl, let it live.
but if they have a baby boy, you must throw it into the nile river.” 
isaiah.
chapter 25.
lord, you are my god.
i honor you and praise your name, because you did amazing things.
the words you said long ago are completely true; everything happened exactly as you said it would.
and you destroyed the city that was protected by strong walls.
now it is only a pile of rocks.
the foreign palace has been destroyed.
it will never be rebuilt.
that is why powerful nations will honor you.
powerful people from strong cities will fear you.
you have been a safe place for poor people in trouble.
you are like a shelter from floods and shade from the heat when powerful men attack.
they are like rain streaming down the walls that protect us from the storm.
like the heat of summer in a dry land, the angry shouts of those foreigners brought us to our knees.
but like a thick cloud that blocks the summer heat, you answered their challenge.
the lord all-powerful will give a feast for all the people on this mountain.
at the feast, there will be the best foods and wines.
the meat will be good and tender, the wine pure and clear.
but now there is a veil covering all nations and people.
this veil is called “death.” 
but death will be destroyed forever.
and the lord god will wipe away every tear from every face.
in the past, all of his people were sad, but god will take away that sadness from the earth.
all of this will happen because the lord said it would.
at that time people will say, “here is our god!
he is the one we have been waiting for.
he has come to save us.
we have been waiting for our lord.
so we will rejoice and be happy when he saves us.” 
the lord’s power is on this mountain, and moab will be defeated.
the lord will trample the enemy like someone walking on straw in a pile of waste.
they will reach out their arms to escape like someone trying to swim.
but their pride will sink with each stroke they take.
he will destroy their high walls and safe places.
he will throw them down into the dust on the ground.

chapter 6.
so in the month of ziv, the second month of the year, during solomon’s fourth year as king, he began work on the temple.
this was 480 years after the israelites left egypt.
the temple was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.
the porch of the temple was 20 cubits long and 10 cubits wide.
the porch ran along the front of the main part of the temple itself.
its length was equal to the width of the temple.
there were narrow windows in the temple.
these windows were smaller on the inside of the wall than on the outside.
then solomon built a row of rooms around the main part of the temple.
this row of rooms was three stories tall with the rooms built one above the other.
the rooms touched the temple wall, but their beams were not built into that wall.
the temple wall became thinner at the top, so the rooms on the upper floors were larger than the ones below them.
the rooms on the bottom floor were 5 cubits wide.
the rooms on the middle floor were 6 cubits wide.
the rooms above that were 7 cubits wide.
the stones were completely finished before they were brought into the temple area, so there was no noise of hammers, axes, or any other iron tools in the temple.
the entrance to these rooms was on bottom floor at the south side of the temple.
inside there were stairs that went up to the second floor and from there to the third floor.
solomon finished building the main part of the temple and then covered it inside with cedar boards.
then he finished building the rooms around the temple.
each story was 5 cubits tall.
the cedar beams in these rooms rested on a ledge of the temple wall.
the lord said to solomon, 
“if you obey all my laws and commands, i will do for you what i promised your father david.
i will live among the children of israel in this temple that you are building, and i will never leave the people of israel.” 
when solomon finished the stonework on the temple, 
the stone walls inside the temple were covered with cedar boards from floor to ceiling.
then the stone floor was covered with pine boards.
they built an inner room 20 cubits long in the back part of the temple.
this room was called the most holy place.
they covered the walls in this room with cedar boards, from floor to ceiling.
in front of the most holy place was the main part of the temple.
this room was 40 cubits long.
they covered the walls in this room with cedar boards—none of the stones in the walls could be seen.
they carved pictures of flowers and gourds into the cedar.
solomon finished the inner room in the back part of the temple.
this room was for the box of the lord’s agreement 
this room was 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 20 cubits high.
solomon covered this room with pure gold.
he also covered the cedar altar with gold.
he covered the inside of the temple with pure gold and wrapped gold chains around it.
the inside of the temple was covered with gold, and the altar in front of the most holy place was covered with gold.
the workers made two statues of cherub angels with wings.
they made the statues from olive wood and put them in the most holy place.
each angel was 10 cubits tall.
both cherub angels were the same size and built the same way.
each one had two wings.
each wing was 5 cubits long.
from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing was 10 cubits.
and each cherub angel was 10 cubits tall.
they put the cherub angels beside one another in the most holy place.
their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.
the other two wings touched each side wall.
the two cherub angels were covered with gold.
the walls around the main room and the inner room were carved with pictures of cherub angels, palm trees, and flowers.
the floor of both rooms was covered with gold.
the workers made two doors from olive wood.
they put these doors at the entrance of the most holy place.
the frame around the doors was made with five sides.
they made the two doors from olive wood.
the workers carved pictures of cherub angels, palm trees, and flowers on the doors.
then they covered the doors with gold.
they also made doors for the entrance to the main room.
they used olive wood to make a square doorframe.
there were two doors made from pine.
each door had two parts that folded together.
they carved pictures of cherub angels, palm trees, and flowers on the doors.
then they covered them with gold.
then they built a wall around the inner yard.
each wall was made from three rows of cut stones and one row of cedar timbers.
they started working on the lord’s temple in the month of ziv, the second month of the year.
this was during solomon’s fourth year as king of israel.
the temple was finished in the month of bul, the eighth month of the year, in solomon’s eleventh year as king.
it took seven years to build the temple.
it was built exactly as planned.
chapter 12.
lord, if i argue with you, you are always right.
but i want to ask you about some things that don’t seem right.
why are wicked people successful?
why do people you cannot trust have such easy lives?
you have put these wicked people here like plants with strong roots.
they grow and produce fruit.
with their mouths they say that you are near and dear to them, but in their hearts they are really far away from you.
but you know my heart, lord.
you see me and test my mind.
drag the evil people away like sheep to be killed.
choose them for the day of slaughter.
how much longer will the land be dry?
how long will the grass be dry and dead?
the birds and the animals of this land have all died, and it is the fault of the wicked.
but they are saying, “jeremiah will not live long enough to see what happens to us.” 
“jeremiah, if running in a race against men makes you tired, how will you race against horses?
if you trip and fall in a safe place, what will you do in a dangerous place?
what will you do in the thornbushes that grow along the jordan river?
these men are your own brothers.
members of your own family are making plans against you.
people from your own family are shouting at you.
don’t trust them, even when they speak to you like friends.
“i have abandoned my house.
i have left my own property.
i have given judah, the one i love, to her enemies.
my own people turned against me like a wild lion.
they roared at me, so i turned away from them.
my own people have become like a dying animal surrounded by vultures.
these birds are circling around her.
come on, wild animals.
come get something to eat.
many shepherds have ruined my vineyard.
they have trampled the plants in my field.
they have made my beautiful field a desert.
they have turned it into an empty desert.
it is dry and dead.
the whole land has been ruined, and no one is left to care for it.
the empty hills are covered with soldiers who have come to destroy everything.
the lord is using them to punish that land from one end to the other.
no one is safe.
the people will plant wheat, but they will harvest only thorns.
they will work hard until they are very tired, but they will get nothing for all their work.
they will be ashamed of their crop.
the lord’s anger caused this.” 
this is what the lord says: “i will tell you what i will do for all those who live around the land of israel.
they are very wicked.
they have destroyed the land i gave to the people of israel.
i will pull the evil people up and throw them out of their land, and i will pull the people of judah up with them.
but after i pull them up out of their land, i will feel sorry for them.
i will bring each family back to its own property and to its own land.
i want these people to learn their lessons well.
in the past they taught my people to use baal’s name to make promises.
now, i want them to learn to use my name.
i want them to say, ‘as the lord lives ….’ if they do that, i will allow them to be successful, and i will let them live among my people.
but if a nation does not listen to my message, i will completely destroy it.
i will pull it up like a dead plant.” this message is from the lord.
chapter 47.
this is the message from the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet about the philistines.
this message came before pharaoh attacked the city of gaza.
this is what the lord says: “look, the enemy is gathering in the north like rising water.
they will come like a river spilling over its banks.
they will cover the whole country like a flood.
they will cover the towns and the people living in them.
everyone in the country will cry for help.
everyone will cry out in pain.
they will hear the sound of running horses, the noisy chariots, the rumbling wheels.
fathers will not be able to protect their children.
they will be too weak to help, 
because the time has come to destroy all the philistines.
the time has come to destroy tyre and sidon’s remaining helpers.
the lord will destroy the philistines, the survivors from the island of crete.
the people from gaza will be sad and shave their heads.
the people from ashkelon will be silenced.
survivors from the valley, how long will you cut yourselves?
“sword of the lord, you have not stopped.
how long will you keep fighting?
go back into your scabbard!
be still!
but how can the sword of the lord rest?
the lord gave it a command.
he commanded it to attack the city of ashkelon and the seacoast.” 
leviticus.
chapter 27.
the lord said to moses, 
“tell the israelites: you might promise to give someone to the lord as a servant.
the priest must set a price for that person.
the price for a man from 20 to 60 years old is 50 shekels of silver.
(you must use the official measure for the silver.)
the price for a woman who is 20 to 60 years old is 30 shekels.
the price for a man from 5 to 20 years old is 20 shekels.
for a woman the price is 10 shekels.
the price for a boy from one month to five years old is 5 shekels.
for a girl, the price is 3 shekels.
the price for a man who is 60 years old or older is 15 shekels.
the price for a woman is 10 shekels.
“if anyone is too poor to pay the price, bring that person to the priest.
the priest will decide how much money the person can afford to pay.
“you might promise to give an animal to the lord.
if it is a clean animal—one that is acceptable as an offering to the lord—then the animal you bring will become holy.
you must not put any other animal in its place.
don’t try to trade a good animal for a bad one or a bad animal for a good one.
if you try to change animals, both animals will become holy—they will both belong to the lord.
“the animal you promised might be one that is not acceptable as an offering to the lord.
if you promised one of these unclean animals, you must bring it to the priest.
the priest will decide a price for that animal.
it doesn’t make any difference if the animal is good or bad.
if the priest decides on a price, that is the price for the animal.
if you want to buy back the animal, then you must add one-fifth to the price.
“if you dedicate your house as holy to the lord, the priest must decide its price.
it doesn’t make any difference if the house is good or bad.
if the priest decides on a price, that is the price for the house.
but if you want to get the house back, you must add one-fifth to the price.
then you will get the house back.
“you might dedicate a field to the lord.
the value of this field will depend on how much seed is needed to plant it.
it will be 50 shekels of silver for each homer of barley seed.
if you give your field to god during the year of jubilee, then its value will be whatever the priest decides.
but if you give your field after the jubilee, the priest must decide its exact price.
he must count the number of years to the next year of jubilee and use that number to decide the price.
if you want to buy the field back, you must add one-fifth to that price.
then you will get the field back.
if you don’t buy the field back and the land is sold to someone else, you cannot get the land back.
if you don’t buy the land back by the year of jubilee, the field will remain holy to the lord—it will belong to the priest forever.
it will be treated like any other thing that was given completely to the lord.
“if you dedicate a field to the lord that you had bought, and it is not a part of your family’s property, 
then the priest must count the years to the year of jubilee and decide the price for the land.
then that land will belong to the lord.
at the year of jubilee, the land will go to the family that originally owned the land.
“you must use the official measure in paying these prices.
the shekel by that measure weighs 20 gerahs.
“you can give cattle and sheep as special gifts to the lord.
but if the animal is the firstborn, it already belongs to the lord.
so you cannot give these animals as special gifts.
if the firstborn animal is an unclean animal, you must buy back that animal.
the priest will decide the price of the animal, and you must add one-fifth to that price.
if you don’t buy that animal back, the priest will sell the animal for whatever price he decides.
“there is a special kind of gift that people give to the lord.
it belongs only to him, and it cannot be bought back or sold.
this gift belongs to the lord.
this type of gift includes people, animals, and fields from the family property.
if this gift is a person, that person cannot be bought back.
that person must be killed.
“a tenth of all crops belongs to the lord.
this means the crops from fields and the fruit from trees—a tenth belongs to the lord.
so if you want to get back your tenth, you must add one-fifth to its price and then buy it back.
“the priests will take every tenth animal from a person’s cattle or sheep.
every tenth animal will belong to the lord.
the owner should not worry if the chosen animal is good or bad or change the animal for another animal.
if this happens, both animals will belong to the lord.
that animal cannot be bought back.” 
these are the commands that the lord gave moses at mount sinai for the israelites.
chapter 13.
this is what the lord said to me: “jeremiah, go and buy a linen loincloth.
then put it around your waist.
don’t let it get wet.” 
so i bought a linen loincloth, just as the lord told me to do, and i put it around my waist.
then the message from the lord came to me a second time.
this was the message: “jeremiah, take the loincloth you bought and are wearing, and go to perath.
hide the loincloth there in a crack in the rocks.” 
so i went to perath and hid the loincloth there, just as the lord told me to do.
many days later the lord said to me, “now, jeremiah, go to perath.
get the loincloth that i told you to hide there.” 
so i went to perath and dug the loincloth out of the crack in the rocks where i had hidden it.
but now i could not wear the loincloth, because it was ruined.
it was not good for anything.
then the message from the lord came to me.
this is what the lord said: “the loincloth is ruined and not good for anything.
in the same way, i will ruin the proud people of judah and jerusalem.
i will ruin them because they refuse to listen to my messages.
they are stubborn and do only what they want to do.
they follow and worship other gods.
they will be like this linen loincloth.
they will be ruined and not good for anything.
a loincloth is wrapped tightly around a man’s waist.
in the same way, i wrapped the family of israel and the family of judah around me.” this message is from the lord.
“i did that so that they would be my people and bring me fame, praise, and honor.
but my people did not listen to me.” 
“jeremiah, say to the people of judah: ‘this is what the lord, the god of israel, says: every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ they will laugh and say to you, ‘of course, we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ 
then you will say to them, ‘this is what the lord says: i will make everyone who lives in this land helpless, like a drunken man.
i am talking about the kings who sit on david’s throne.
i am also talking about the priests, the prophets, and all the people who live in jerusalem.
i will make them stumble and fall against each another, even the fathers and sons.’ this message is from the lord.
‘i will not feel sorry or have pity for them.
i will not allow compassion to stop me from destroying the people of judah.’” 
listen and pay attention.
the lord has spoken to you.
do not be proud.
honor the lord your god.
praise him or he will bring darkness.
praise him before you fall on the dark hills.
you people of judah are hoping for light, but the lord will turn the light into thick darkness.
he will change it into the deepest gloom.
if you people of judah don’t listen to him, i will hide and cry.
your pride will cause me to cry.
i will cry very hard.
my eyes will overflow with tears, because the lord’s flock will be captured.
tell these things to the king and his wife, “come down from your thrones.
your beautiful crowns have fallen from your heads.” 
the cities in the negev are locked.
no one can open them.
all the people of judah have been taken away as captives.
they were carried away as prisoners.
jerusalem, look!
the enemy is coming from the north!
where is the flock you were once in charge of?
that beautiful flock is gone now.
i will let your enemies become your rulers— people you once trusted with your secrets.
what will you say then?
surely you will feel great pain, like a woman giving birth.
you might ask yourself, “why has this bad thing happened to me?” it happened because of your many sins.
because of your sins, your skirt was torn off, and your sandals were taken away.
they did this to embarrass you.
a black man cannot change the color of his skin, and a leopard cannot change its spots.
in the same way, jerusalem, you cannot change and do good.
you always do bad things.
“i will force you to leave your homes.
you will run in all directions.
you will be like chaff blown away by the desert wind.
this is what will happen to you.
this is your part in my plans.” this message is from the lord.
“why will this happen?
because you forgot me.
you trusted false gods.
jerusalem, i will pull your skirt up over your face.
everyone will see you, and you will be ashamed.
i saw the terrible things you did.
i saw you laughing and having sex with your lovers.
i know about your plans to be like a prostitute.
i have seen you on the hills and in the fields.
it will be very bad for you, jerusalem.
how long will you continue doing your dirty sins?”

chapter 16.
the levites brought god’s holy box and put it inside the tent david had set up for it.
then they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to god.
after david had finished giving the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he used the lord’s name to bless the people.
then he gave a loaf of bread, some dates, and raisins to every israelite man and woman.
then david chose some of the levites to serve before the lord’s holy box.
they had the job of celebrating and giving thanks and praise to the lord, the god of israel.
asaph was the leader of the first group.
his group played the cymbals.
zechariah was the leader of the second group.
the other levites were uzziel, shemiramoth, jehiel, mattithiah, eliab, benaiah, obed edom, and jeiel.
these men played the lyres and harps.
benaiah and jahaziel were the priests who always blew the trumpets before the box of god’s agreement.
this was when david first gave asaph and his brothers the job of singing praises to the lord.
give thanks to the lord and call out to him!
tell the nations what he has done!
sing to him; sing praises to him.
tell about the amazing things he has done.
be proud of his holy name.
you followers of the lord, be happy!
depend on the lord for strength.
always go to him for help.
remember the amazing things he has done.
remember his miracles and his fair decisions.
the people of israel are his servants.
the descendants of jacob are his chosen people.
the lord is our god.
he rules the whole world.
remember his agreement forever, the promise he gave that will never end.
remember the agreement he made with abraham remember his promise to isaac.
he gave it as a law for jacob, as an agreement with israel that will last forever.
he said, “i will give you the land of canaan.
it will be your very own.” 
at the time god said this, there were only a few of his people, and they were strangers there.
they traveled around from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
but the lord did not let anyone mistreat them.
he warned kings not to harm them.
he said, “don’t hurt my chosen people.
don’t hurt my prophets.” 
let the whole world sing to the lord!
tell the good news every day about how he saves us.
tell all the nations how wonderful he is!
tell people everywhere about the amazing things he does.
the lord is great and worthy of praise.
he is more awesome than any of the “gods.” 
all the “gods” in other nations are nothing but statues, but the lord made the heavens!
he lives in the presence of glory and honor.
his temple is a place of power and joy.
praise the lord, all people of every nation; praise the lord’s glory and power!
give the lord praise worthy of his glory.
come into his presence with your offerings.
worship the lord in all his holy beauty.
everyone on earth should tremble before him!
but the world stands firm and cannot be moved.
let the heavens rejoice and the earth be happy!
let people everywhere say, “the lord rules!” 
let the sea and everything in it shout for joy!
let the fields and everything in them be happy!
the trees of the forest will sing for joy when they see the lord, because he is coming to rule the world.
give thanks to the lord because he is good.
his faithful love will last forever.
say to him, “save us, god our savior.
bring us back together, and save us from the other nations.
then we will give thanks to your holy name and joyfully praise you.” 
praise the lord, the god of israel!
he always was and will always be worthy of praise!
all the people praised the lord and said “amen!” 
then david left asaph and his brothers there in front of the box of the lord’s agreement.
david left them there to serve in front of it every day.
he also left obed edom and 68 other levites to serve with asaph and his brothers.
obed edom and hosah were guards.
obed edom was jeduthun’s son.
david left zadok the priest and the other priests who served with him in front of the lord’s tent at the high place in gibeon.
every morning and evening zadok and the other priests offered burnt offerings to the lord on the altar of burnt offerings.
they did this to follow the rules written in the law of the lord, which he had given israel.
heman, jeduthun, and all the other levites were chosen by name to praise the lord, singing, “his faithful love will last forever.” 
heman and jeduthun were with them.
they had the job of blowing the trumpets and playing cymbals.
they also had the job of playing other musical instruments when songs were sung to god.
jeduthun’s sons guarded the gates.
after the celebration, all the people left and went home.
david also went home to bless his family.
chapter 10.
“at that time the lord said to me, ‘you must cut out two stone tablets like the first two stones.
then you must come up to me on the mountain.
also make a wooden box.
i will write on the stone tablets the same words that were on the first stones—the stones you broke.
then you must put these new stones in the box.’ 
“so i made a box from acacia wood.
i cut two stone tablets like the first two stones.
then i went up on the mountain.
i had the two stone tablets in my hand.
and the lord wrote on the stones the same words he had written before—the ten commandments he spoke to you from the fire, when you were gathered together at the mountain.
then the lord gave the two stone tablets to me.
i came back down from the mountain.
i put the stones in the box i had made.
the lord commanded me to put them there.
and the stones are still there in that box.” 
(the israelites traveled from the wells of the people of jaakan to moserah.
there aaron died and was buried.
aaron’s son eleazar served in aaron’s place as priest.
then the israelites went from moserah to gudgodah.
and they went from gudgodah to jotbathah, a land of rivers.
at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi from the other tribes for his special work.
they had the work of carrying the lord’s box of the agreement.
they also served as priests before the lord.
and they had the work of blessing people in the lord’s name.
they still do this special work today.
that is why the people from the tribe of levi did not get any share of land like the other tribes did.
they have the lord for their share.
that is what the lord your god promised them.)
“i stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights, like the first time.
the lord also listened to me at that time.
he decided not to destroy you.
the lord said to me, ‘go and lead the people on their trip.
they will go in and live in the land that i promised to give to their ancestors.’ 
“now, israelites, listen!
what does the lord your god really want from you?
the lord your god wants you to respect him and do what he says.
he wants you to love him and to serve the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul.
so obey the laws and commands of the lord that i am giving you today.
these laws and commands are for your own good.
“everything belongs to the lord your god.
the heavens, even the highest heavens, belong to him.
the earth and everything on it belong to him.
the lord loved your ancestors very much.
he loved them so much that he chose you, their descendants, to be his people.
he chose you instead of any other nation, and you are still his chosen people today.
“stop being stubborn.
give your hearts to god.
the lord is your god.
he is the god of gods and the lord of lords.
he is the great god.
he is the amazing and powerful fighter.
to him everyone is the same.
he does not accept money to change his mind.
he defends widows and orphans.
he loves even the strangers living among us.
he gives them food and clothes.
so you must also love them, because you yourselves were strangers in the land of egypt.
“you must respect the lord your god and worship only him.
never leave him.
when you make promises, you must use his name only.
he is the one you should praise.
he is your god.
he has done great and amazing things for you.
you have seen them with your own eyes.
when your ancestors went down into egypt, there were only 70 people.
now the lord your god has made you as many as the stars in the sky.
chapter 6.
that same night, the king could not sleep.
so he told a servant to bring the history book and read it to him.
(the book of history of the kings lists everything that happens during a king’s rule.)
the servant read the book to the king.
he read about the evil plan to kill king xerxes.
that was when mordecai had learned about bigthana and teresh.
these two men were the king’s officers who guarded the doorway.
they had planned to kill the king, but mordecai learned about the plan and told someone about it.
then the king asked, “what honor and good things have been given to mordecai for this?” the servants answered the king, “nothing has been done for mordecai.” 
haman had just entered the outer area of the king’s palace.
he had come to ask the king to hang mordecai on the hanging post haman had commanded to be built.
the king said, “who just came into the courtyard?” 
the king’s servants said, “haman is standing in the courtyard.” so the king said, “bring him in.” 
when haman came in, the king asked him a question.
he said, “haman, what should be done for a man the king wants to honor?” haman thought to himself, “who is there that the king would want to honor more than me?
i’m sure that the king is talking about honoring me.” 
so haman answered the king, “do this for the man the king loves to honor: 
have the servants bring a special robe the king himself has worn and a horse the king himself has ridden.
have the servants put the king’s special mark on the horse’s head.
then put one of the king’s most important leaders in charge of the robe and the horse, and let the leader put the robe on the man the king wants to honor.
then let him lead him on the horse through the city streets.
as he leads him, let him announce, ‘this is done for the man the king wants to honor!’” 
“go quickly,” the king commanded haman.
“get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for mordecai the jew.
he is sitting near the king’s gate.
do everything that you suggested.” 
so haman got the robe and the horse.
then he put the robe on mordecai and led him on horseback through the city streets.
haman announced ahead of mordecai, “this is done for the man the king wants to honor!” 
after that mordecai went back to the king’s gate, but haman hurried home with his head covered because he was embarrassed and ashamed.
then haman told his wife zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him.
his wife and the men who gave him advice said, “if mordecai is a jew, you cannot win.
you have already started to fall.
surely you will be ruined!” 
while they were still talking to haman, the king’s eunuchs came to haman’s house.
they made haman hurry to the party that esther had prepared.
chapter 53.
who really believed what we heard?
who saw in it the lord’s great power?
he was always close to the lord.
he grew up like a young plant, like a root growing in dry ground.
there was nothing special or impressive about the way he looked, nothing we could see that would cause us to like him.
people made fun of him, and even his friends left him.
he was a man who suffered a lot of pain and sickness.
we treated him like someone of no importance, like someone people will not even look at but turn away from in disgust.
the fact is, it was our suffering he took on himself; he bore our pain.
but we thought that god was punishing him, that god was beating him for something he did.
but he was being punished for what we did.
he was crushed because of our guilt.
he took the punishment we deserved, and this brought us peace.
we were healed because of his pain.
we had all wandered away like sheep.
we had gone our own way.
and yet the lord put all our guilt on him.
he was treated badly, but he never protested.
he said nothing, like a lamb being led away to be killed.
he was like a sheep that makes no sound as its wool is being cut off.
he never opened his mouth to defend himself.
he was taken away by force and judged unfairly.
the people of his time did not even notice that he was killed.
but he was put to death for the sins of his people.
he had done no wrong to anyone.
he had never even told a lie.
but he was buried among the wicked.
his tomb was with the rich.
but the lord was pleased with this humble servant who suffered such pain.
even after giving himself as an offering for sin, he will see his descendants and enjoy a long life.
he will succeed in doing what the lord wanted.
after his suffering he will see the light, and he will be satisfied with what he experienced.
the lord says, “my servant, who always does what is right, will make his people right with me; he will take away their sins.
for this reason, i will treat him as one of my great people.
i will give him the rewards of one who wins in battle, and he will share them with his powerful ones.
i will do this because he gave his life for the people.
he was considered a criminal, but the truth is, he carried away the sins of many.
now he will stand before me and speak for those who have sinned.”

his mother’s name was jerusha.
jerusha was zadok’s daughter.
jotham did what the lord wanted him to do.
he obeyed god just as his father uzziah had done.
but jotham did not enter the lord’s temple to burn incense as his father had.
but the people continued doing wrong.
jotham rebuilt the upper gate of the lord’s temple.
he did much building on the wall at the place named ophel.
he also built towns in the hill country of judah.
he built fortresses and towers in the forests.
jotham also fought against the king of the ammonites and his army and defeated them.
so each year for three years the ammonites gave jotham 3 3/4 tons of silver, 62,000 bushels of wheat, and 62,000 bushels of barley.

jotham was 25 years old when he became king.
he ruled 16 years in jerusalem.
then jotham died and was buried with his ancestors.

chapter 5.
my darling my bride, i have entered my garden.
i have gathered my myrrh and spice.
i have eaten my honey and honeycomb.
i have drunk my wine and milk.
dearest friends, eat, drink!
be drunk with love!
i am asleep, but my heart is awake.
i hear my lover knocking, saying, “open to me, my darling, my love, my dove, my perfect one!
my head is soaked with dew.
my hair is wet with the mist of the night.” 
“i have taken off my robe.
i don’t want to put it on again.
i have washed my feet.
i don’t want to get them dirty again.” 
but my lover put his hand through the opening, and i felt sorry for him.
i got up to open for my lover, myrrh dripping from my hands, myrrh scented lotion dripped from my fingers onto the handles of the lock.
i opened for my lover, but my lover had turned away and was gone!
i nearly died when he came and went.
i looked for him, but i couldn’t find him.
i called for him, but he didn’t answer me.
the guards patrolling the city found me.
they hit me.
they hurt me.
the guards on the wall took my robe from me.
i tell you, women of jerusalem, if you find my lover, tell him i am weak with love.
beautiful woman, how is your lover different from other lovers?
is your lover better than other lovers?
is that why you ask us to make this promise?
my lover is tanned and radiant.
he would stand out among 10,000 men.
his head is like the purest gold.
his hair is curly and as black as a raven.
his eyes are like doves by a stream, like doves in a pool of milk, like a jewel in its setting.
his cheeks are like a garden of spices, like flowers used for perfume.
his lips are like lilies, dripping with liquid myrrh.
his arms are like gold rods, filled with jewels.
his body is like smooth ivory with sapphires set in it.
his legs are like marble pillars on bases of fine gold.
he stands tall like the finest cedar tree in lebanon!
yes, women of jerusalem, my lover is everything i desire.
his mouth is the sweetest of all.
this is my lover; this is my darling.
chapter 49.
this message is about the ammonites.
this is what the lord says: “ammonites, do you think that the people of israel don’t have children?
do you think there are no children to take the land when the parents die?
maybe that is why milcom took gad’s land?” 
the lord says, “the time will come in rabbah of ammon when people hear the sounds of battle.
rabbah of ammon will be destroyed.
it will be an empty hill covered with ruined buildings, and the towns around it will be burned.
those people forced the people of israel to leave their own land.
but later, israel will force them to leave.” this is what the lord said.
“people in heshbon, cry because the town of ai is destroyed!
women in rabbah of ammon, cry!
put on sackcloth and cry.
run to the city for safety, because the enemy will take away the god milcom, with his priests and officials.
you brag about your strength, but you are losing your strength.
you trust in your wealth to save you.
you think no one would even think of attacking you.” 
but this is what the lord god all-powerful says: “i will bring troubles to you from every side.
you will all run away, and no one will be able to bring you together again.” 
“the ammonites will be taken away as captives.
but the time will come when i will bring the ammonites back.” this message is from the lord.
this message is about edom.
this is what the lord all-powerful says: “is there no more wisdom in teman?
are the wise men of edom not able to give good advice?
have they lost their wisdom?
you people living in dedan, run away and hide, because i will punish esau for the bad things he did.
“workers pick grapes from grapevines, but they leave a few grapes on the plants.
if thieves come at night, they don’t take everything.
but i will take everything from esau.
i will find all his hiding places.
he will not be able to hide from me.
his children, relatives, and neighbors will all die.
no one will be left to care for his children.
his wives will have no one to depend on.” 
this is what the lord says: “some people don’t deserve to be punished, but they suffer.
but, edom, you deserve to be punished, so you will really be punished.
you will not escape the punishment you deserve.
you will be punished.” 
the lord says, “by my own power, i make this promise: i promise that the city of bozrah will be destroyed.
it will become a ruined pile of rocks.
people will use it as an example when they ask for bad things to happen to other cities.
people will insult that city, and all the towns around bozrah will become ruins forever.” 
i heard a message from the lord: he sent this messenger to the nations.
this is the message: “gather your armies together!
get ready for battle!
march against the nation of edom!
edom, i will make you become unimportant.
everyone will hate you.
edom, you made other nations afraid, so you thought you were important.
but your pride has fooled you.
you live in caves, high on the cliff.
your home is high in the hills.
but even if you build your home as high as an eagle’s nest, i will bring you down from there.” this is what the lord said.
“edom will be destroyed.
people will be shocked to see the destroyed cities.
they will whistle from amazement at the destroyed cities.
edom will be destroyed like sodom and gomorrah and the towns around them.
no one will live there.” this is what the lord said.
“sometimes a lion will come from the thick bushes near the jordan river.
and it will go into the fields where people put their sheep and cattle.
i am like that lion.
i will go to edom.
and i will frighten the people and make them run away.
none of their young men will stop me.
no one is like me.
no one will challenge me.
none of their leaders will stand up against me.” 
so listen to what the lord has planned to do to the people of edom.
listen to what he has decided to do to the people in teman.
the enemy will drag away the young kids of edom’s flock.
edom’s pastures will be empty because of what they did.
at the sound of edom’s fall, the earth will shake.
their cry will be heard all the way to the red sea.
just as an eagle flies high to see the animal it will attack, so the lord will spread his wings over bozrah.
and edom’s soldiers will be filled with fear like a woman giving birth.
this message is about the city of damascus: “the towns of hamath and arpad are afraid.
they are afraid because they heard the bad news.
they are discouraged.
they are worried and afraid.
the city of damascus has become weak.
the people want to run away.
they are ready to panic.
they are overcome with fear and pain, like a woman giving birth.
“damascus is a happy city.
the people have not left that ‘fun city’ yet.
so the young men will die in the public squares of that city.
all her soldiers will be killed at that time.” this is what the lord all-powerful said.
“i will set the walls of damascus on fire.
the fire will completely burn up the strong forts of ben-hadad.” 
this message is about the tribe of kedar and the rulers of hazor.
king nebuchadnezzar of babylon defeated them.
this is what the lord says: “go and attack the tribe of kedar.
destroy the people of the east.
their tents and flocks will be taken away.
their tents and all their riches will be carried off.
their enemy will take away the camels.
men will shout this to them: ‘terrible things are happening all around us.’ 
run away quickly!
people in hazor, find a good place to hide.” this message is from the lord.
“nebuchadnezzar has made plans against you.
he thought of a smart plan to defeat you.
“there is a nation that feels so safe and secure that it does not have gates or fences to protect it.
and no one lives near enough to help them.
so attack that nation!” says the lord.
“their camels are there to be taken in battle.
their large herds of cattle will be yours.
i will scatter them throughout the earth—those people who cut their hair short.
i will bring disaster on them from every direction.” this message is from the lord.
“hazor will become a home for wild dogs, an empty desert forever.
no one will live there.
no one will stay in that place.” 
early in the time when zedekiah was king of judah, jeremiah the prophet received a message from the lord about the nation of elam.
the lord all-powerful says, “i will break elam’s bow very soon.
it is elam’s strongest weapon.
i will bring the four winds against elam.
i will bring them from the four corners of the skies.
i will send the people of elam to every place on the earth where the four winds blow.
elam’s captives will be carried away to every nation.
i will break elam to pieces while their enemies are watching.
i will break elam in front of the people who want to kill them.
i will bring terrible troubles to them.
i will show them how angry i am.” this message is from the lord.
“i will send a sword to chase elam.
the sword will chase them until i have killed them all.
i will show elam that i am in control, and i will destroy its king and his officials.” this message is from the lord.
“but in the future i will make good things happen to elam.” this message is from the lord.
chapter 15.
then moses and the israelites began singing this song to the lord: “i will sing to the lord!
he has done great things.
he threw horse and rider into the sea.
the lord is my strength.
he saves me, and i sing songs of praise to him.
he is my god, and i praise him.
he is the god of my ancestors, and i honor him.
the lord is a great soldier.
the lord is his name.
he threw pharaoh’s chariots and soldiers into the sea.
pharaoh’s very best soldiers drowned in the red sea.
the deep water covered them, and they sank to the bottom like rocks.
“lord, your right hand is amazingly strong.
with your right hand, lord, you broke the enemy to pieces.
in your great majesty you destroyed those who stood against you.
your anger destroyed them, like fire burning straw.
the wind you sent in anger piled the water high.
the flowing water became a wall, solid to its deepest parts.
“the enemy said, ‘i’ll chase them and catch them.
i’ll take all their riches.
i’ll take it all with my sword.
i’ll take everything for myself.’ 
but you blew on them and covered them with the sea.
they sank like lead into the deep sea.
“are there any gods like the lord?
no, there are no gods like you— you are wonderfully holy!
you are amazingly powerful!
you do great miracles!
you raised your right hand to punish the enemy, and the ground opened up to swallow them.
but with your kindness you led the people you saved.
and with your strength you led them to your holy land.
“the other nations will hear this story, and they will be frightened.
the philistines will shake with fear.
the commanders of edom will tremble.
the leaders of moab will be afraid.
the people of canaan will lose courage.
they will be filled with fear when they see your strength.
they will be as still as a rock, lord, while your people, the ones you made, pass by.
you will lead your people to your own mountain.
you will let them live by the place that you, lord, prepared as your home.
it is the temple, lord, that you yourself built.
“the lord will rule forever and ever!” 
yes, it really happened!
pharaoh’s horses and riders, and chariots went into the sea.
and the lord brought all the water of the sea down on top of them.
but the israelites walked through that sea on dry land.
then aaron’s sister, the woman prophet miriam, took a tambourine.
she and the women began singing and dancing.
miriam repeated the words, “sing to the lord!
he has done great things.
he threw horse and rider into the sea ….” 
moses led the israelites away from the red sea and into the desert of shur.
they traveled for three days in the desert.
they could not find any water.
then they came to marah.
there was water at marah, but it was too bitter to drink.
(that is why the place was named marah.)
the people began complaining to moses.
they said, “now what will we drink?” 
so moses called to the lord, and the lord showed him a large piece of wood.
when moses put the wood in the water, the water became good to drink.
there the lord put in place a law and a command for him and tested him to see if he would obey.
he said to him, “i am the lord your god.
if you listen to me and do what i say is right, and if you obey all my commands and laws, then i will not give you any of the sicknesses that i gave the egyptians.
i am the lord who heals you.” 
then the people traveled to elim.
at elim there were twelve springs of water and 70 palm trees.
so the people made their camp there near that water.

chapter 19.
nahash was king of the ammonites.
when nahash died, his son became the new king.
then david said, “nahash was kind to me, so i will be kind to hanun, nahash’s son.” so david sent messengers to comfort hanun about the death of his father.
david’s messengers went to the country of ammon to comfort hanun.
but the ammonite leaders said to hanun, “don’t be fooled.
david didn’t really send these men to comfort you or to honor your dead father!
no, david sent his servants to spy on you and your land.
he really wants to destroy your country!” 
so hanun arrested david’s servants and cut off their beards.
hanun also cut their clothes off at the hip and sent them away.
david’s men were too embarrassed to go home.
some people went to david and told him what happened to his men.
so king david sent this message to his men: “stay in the town of jericho until your beards grow again.
then you can come back home.” 
the ammonites saw they had caused themselves to become hated enemies of david.
then hanun and the ammonites used 75,000 pounds of silver to buy chariots and chariot drivers from mesopotamia.
they also got chariots and chariot drivers from the towns of maacah and zobah in aram.
the ammonites bought 32,000 chariots.
they also paid the king of maacah and his army to come and help them.
the king of maacah and his people came and set up a camp near the town of medeba.
the ammonites themselves came out of their towns and got ready for battle.
david heard that the ammonites were getting ready for war.
so he sent joab and the whole army of israel to fight the ammonites.
the ammonites came out and got ready for battle.
they were near the city gate.
the kings who had come to help stayed out in the fields by themselves.
joab saw that there were two army groups ready to fight against him.
one group was in front of him and the other group was behind him.
so joab chose some of the best soldiers of israel and sent them out to fight against the aramean army.
he put the rest of the israelite army under his brother abishai’s command.
these soldiers went out to fight against the ammonite army.
joab said to abishai, “if the arameans are too strong for me, you must help me.
but if the ammonites are too strong for you, i will help you.
let’s be brave and strong while we fight for our people and for the cities of our god!
may the lord do what he thinks is right.” 
joab and the army with him attacked the aramean army.
the arameans ran away from joab and his army.
when the ammonite army saw that the aramean army was running away, they also ran away.
they ran away from abishai and his army.
the ammonites went back to their city, and joab went back to jerusalem.
the aramean leaders saw that israel had defeated them.
so they sent messengers to get help from the arameans living east of the euphrates river.
shophach was the commander of hadadezer’s army from aram.
shophach also led the other aramean soldiers.
david heard the news that the arameans were gathering for battle, so he gathered all the israelites.
david led them across the jordan river, and they came face to face with the arameans.
david got his army ready for battle and they attacked the arameans.
the arameans ran away from the israelites.
david and his army killed 7000 aramean chariot drivers and 40,000 aramean soldiers.
david and his army also killed shophach, the commander of the aramean army.
when hadadezer’s officers saw that israel had defeated them, they made peace with david.
they became his servants.
so the arameans refused to help the ammonites again.
chapter 1.
jerusalem once was a city full of people, but now the city is so empty.
she was one of the greatest cities in the world, but now she is like a poor widow.
she was once a princess among cities, but now she has been made a slave.
she cries bitterly in the night.
her tears are on her cheeks.
she has no one to comfort her.
many nations were friendly to her, but not one of them comforts her now.
all her friends have turned their backs on her and have become her enemies.
judah suffered very much, and then she was taken into captivity.
she lives among other nations but has found no rest.
the people who chased her caught her where there was no way out.
the roads to zion are very sad, because no one comes to zion for the festivals anymore.
all of zion’s gates have been destroyed; all her priests groan in sorrow.
zion’s young women have been taken away, and all this made zion sad.
jerusalem’s enemies have won.
her enemies have been successful.
this happened because the lord punished her.
he punished jerusalem for her many sins.
her children have gone away.
their enemies captured them and took them away.
the beauty of daughter zion has gone away.
her princes were like deer that cannot find a meadow to feed in.
they walk away without strength from those who chased them.
jerusalem thinks back.
she remembers the time when she was hurt and when she lost her home.
she remembers all the nice things that she had in the past.
she remembers those nice things that she had in the old days.
she remembers when her people were captured by the enemy.
she remembers when there was no one to help her.
when her enemies saw her, they laughed, because she was destroyed.
jerusalem sinned very badly.
because jerusalem sinned, she became a ruined city that people shake their heads about.
in the past people respected her.
but now they hate her, because they abused her.
jerusalem groaned and turned away.
jerusalem’s skirts were dirty.
she gave no thought to what would become of her.
her fall was amazing.
she had no one to comfort her.
she says, “lord, see how i am hurt!
see how my enemy thinks he is so great!” 
the enemy stretched out his hand.
he took all her nice things.
in fact, she saw the foreign nations go inside her temple.
and you said those people could not join in our assembly!
all the people of jerusalem are groaning.
all of her people are looking for food.
they are giving away all their nice things for food to stay alive.
jerusalem says, “look, lord.
look at me!
see how people hate me.
all you who pass by on the road, you don’t seem to care.
but look at me and see.
is there any pain like my pain?
is there any pain like the pain that has come to me?
is there any pain like the pain that the lord has punished me with?
he has punished me on the day of his great anger.
the lord sent fire from above that went down into my bones.
he stretched out a net for my feet.
he turned me all the way around.
he made me into a wasteland.
i am sick all day.
“my sins were tied up like a yoke.
my sins were tied up in the lord’s hands.
his yoke is on my neck.
he has made me weak.
he has given me to those who i cannot stand up against.
“the lord rejected all my powerful men who were inside the city.
then he brought a group of people against me.
he brought them to kill my young soldiers.
the lord has trampled his dearest city like grapes in a winepress.
“i cry about all these things.
tears are flowing down my cheeks.
there is no one near to comfort me.
there is no one who can make me feel better.
my children are like a wasteland, because the enemy won.” 
zion spread out her hands.
there was no one to comfort her.
the lord had given orders to jacob’s enemies.
he ordered them to surround the city.
jerusalem has become a dirty rag that her enemies threw away.
now jerusalem says, “i refused to listen to the lord, so he is right for doing these things.
so listen, all you people!
look at my pain!
my young women and men have gone into captivity.
i called out to my lovers, but they tricked me.
my priests and my elders have died in the city.
they were looking for food for themselves.
they wanted to keep themselves alive.
“look at me, lord.
i am in distress!
i am upset, as if my heart turned upside down inside of me.
i feel this way because i have been so stubborn.
out in the streets, i lost my children to the swords.
inside, it is like death.
“listen to me, i am groaning.
i have no one to comfort me.
all my enemies have heard of my trouble.
they are happy that you did this to me.
you said there would be a time of punishment.
you said you would punish my enemies.
now do what you said.
let my enemies be like i am now.
“look how evil my enemies are!
then you can treat them the same way you treated me because of all my sins.
do this because i am groaning again and again.
do this because my heart is sick.” 
ecclesiastes.
chapter 12.
remember your creator while you are young, before the bad times come—before the years come when you say, “i have wasted my life.” 
remember your creator while you are young, before the time comes when the sun and the moon and the stars become dark to you—before problems come again and again like one storm after another.
at that time your arms will lose their strength.
your legs will become weak and bent.
your teeth will fall out, and you will not be able to chew your food.
your eyes will not see clearly.
you will become hard of hearing.
you will not hear the noise in the streets.
even the stone grinding your grain will seem quiet to you.
you will not be able to hear the women singing.
but even the sound of a bird singing will wake you early in the morning because you will not be able to sleep.
you will be afraid of high places.
you will be afraid of tripping over every small thing in your path.
your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree.
you will drag yourself along like a grasshopper when you walk.
you will lose your desire, and then you will go to your eternal home.
the mourners will gather in the streets as they carry your body to the grave.
remember your creator while you are young, before the silver rope snaps and the golden bowl is crushed like a jar broken at the well, like a stone cover on a well that breaks and falls in.
your body came from the earth.
and when you die, it will return to the earth.
but your spirit came from god, and when you die, it will return to him.
everything is so meaningless.
the teacher says that it is all a waste of time!
the teacher was very wise.
he used his wisdom to teach the people.
he very carefully studied and arranged many wise teachings.
the teacher tried very hard to find the right words, and he wrote the teachings that are true and dependable.
words from the wise are like sharp goads.
when these sayings are written down and saved, they can be used to guide people, just as a shepherd uses a sharp stick to make his sheep go the right way.
so, son, study these sayings, but be careful about other teachings.
people are always writing books, and too much study will make you very tired.
now, what should we learn from everything that is written in this book?
the most important thing a person can do is to respect god and obey his commands, because he knows about everything people do—even the secret things.
he knows about all the good and all the bad, and he will judge people for everything they do.
chapter 38.
then bezalel used acacia wood to build the altar.
this was the altar used for burning offerings.
the altar was square.
it was 5 cubits long, 5 cubits wide, and 3 cubits high.
he made a horn for each of the four corners of the altar.
he joined each horn to its corner so that everything was one piece.
he covered the altar with bronze.
then he used bronze to make all the tools to be used on the altar.
he made the pots, shovels, bowls, forks, and pans.
then he made a bronze grating for the altar.
this grating was shaped like a net.
the grating was put under the ledge at the bottom of the altar.
it went halfway up into the altar from below.
then he made bronze rings to hold the poles for carrying the altar.
he put the rings at the four corners of the grating.
then he used acacia wood to make the poles and covered them with bronze.
he put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar to carry it.
he used boards to make the sides of the altar.
it was hollow, like an empty box.
he made the bowl and its base with bronze.
he used the bronze mirrors that the women gave.
these were the women who served at the entrance to the meeting tent.
then he made a wall of curtains around the courtyard.
on the south side, he made a wall of curtains 100 cubits long.
the curtains were made from fine linen.
the curtains on the south side were supported by 20 posts.
the posts were on 20 bronze bases.
the hooks for the posts and the curtain rods were made from silver.
the north side of the courtyard also had a wall of curtains 100 cubits long.
there were 20 posts with 20 bronze bases.
the hooks for the posts and the curtain rods were made from silver.
on the west side of the courtyard the wall of curtains was 50 cubits long.
there were 10 posts and 10 bases.
the hooks for the posts and the curtain rods were made from silver.
the east side of the courtyard was 50 cubits wide.
the entrance to the courtyard was on this side.
on one side of the entrance the wall of curtains was 15 cubits long.
there were three posts and three bases on this side.
the wall of curtains on the other side of the entrance was also 15 cubits long.
there were three posts and three bases on that side.
all the curtains around the courtyard were made from fine linen.
the bases for the posts were made from bronze.
the hooks and the curtain rods were made from silver.
the tops of the posts were covered with silver also.
all the posts in the courtyard had silver curtain rods.
the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard was made from fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn.
designs were woven into that curtain.
the curtain was 20 cubits long and 5 cubits high.
it was the same height as the curtains around the courtyard.
the curtain was supported by four posts and four bronze bases.
the hooks on the posts were made from silver.
the tops on the posts were covered with silver, and the curtain rods were also made from silver.
all the tent pegs for the holy tent and for the curtains around the courtyard were made from bronze.
moses commanded the levites to write down everything that was used to make the holy tent, that is, the tent of the agreement.
ithamar son of aaron was in charge of keeping the list.
bezalel son of uri, the son of hur, from the tribe of judah, made everything the lord commanded moses.
also oholiab son of ahisamach, from the tribe of dan, helped him.
oholiab was a skilled worker and designer.
he was skilled at weaving fine linen and blue, purple, and red yarn.
the people gave over a ton of gold as an offering to the lord for his holy place.
(this was weighed using the official measure.)
all the men 20 years old or older were counted.
each man had to pay a tax of 1 beka of silver.
(using the official measure, 1 beka is 1/2 shekel.)
there were 603,550 men.
so they collected about 7550 pounds of silver.
they used most of the silver to make 100 bases for the holy tent and its curtains, 75 pounds for each base.
they used the remaining 44 pounds of silver to make the hooks, the curtain rods, and the silver covers for the posts.
they gave more than 2 1/2 tons of bronze.
that bronze was used to make the bases at the entrance of the meeting tent.
they also used the bronze to make the altar and the bronze grating.
and the bronze was used to make all the tools and dishes for the altar.
it was also used to make the bases for the curtains around the courtyard and the bases for the curtains at the entrance.
and the bronze was used to make the tent pegs for the holy tent and for the curtains around the courtyard.
chapter 38.
the word of the lord came to me.
he said, 
“son of man, look toward gog in the land of magog.
he is the most important leader of the nations of meshech and tubal.
speak for me against gog.
tell him that this is what the lord god says: ‘gog, you are the most important leader of the nations of meshech and tubal, but i am against you.
i will capture you and bring you back.
i will bring back all the men in your army, all the horses, and horse soldiers.
i will put hooks in your mouths, and i will bring all of you back.
all the soldiers will be wearing their uniforms with all their shields and swords.
soldiers from persia, ethiopia, and put will be with them.
they will all be wearing their shields and helmets.
there will also be gomer with all its groups of soldiers, and there will be the nation of togarmah from the far north with all its groups of soldiers.
there will be many people in that parade of prisoners.
“‘be prepared.
yes, prepare yourself and the armies that have joined with you.
you must watch and be ready.
after a long time you will be called for duty.
in the later years you will come into the land that has been healed from war.
the people in that land were gathered from many nations and brought back to the mountains of israel.
in the past, the mountains of israel had been destroyed again and again.
but these people will have come back from those other nations.
they all will have lived in safety.
but you will come to attack them.
you will come like a storm.
you will come like a thundercloud covering the land.
you and all your groups of soldiers from many nations will come to attack them.’” 
this is what the lord god says: “at that time an idea will come into your mind.
you will begin to make an evil plan.
you will say, ‘i will go attack the country that has towns without walls.
the people there live in peace and think they are safe.
there are no walls around the cities to protect them.
they don’t have any locks on their gates—they don’t even have gates!
i will defeat them and take all their valuable things away from them.
i will fight against the places that were destroyed but now have people living in them.
i will fight against the people who were gathered from the nations.
now they have cattle and property.
they live at the crossroads of the world.’ 
“sheba, dedan, and merchants of tarshish and all the cities they trade with will ask you, ‘did you come to capture valuable things?
did you bring your groups of soldiers together to grab the good things and to carry away silver, gold, cattle, and property?
did you come to take all those valuable things?’ 
“son of man, speak to gog for me.
tell him that this is what the lord god says: ‘you will come to attack my people while they are living in peace and safety.
you will come from your place out of the far north, and you will bring many people with you.
all of them will ride on horses.
you will be a large and a powerful army.
you will come to fight against my people israel.
you will be like a thundercloud covering the land.
when that time comes, i will bring you to fight against my land.
then, gog, the nations will learn how powerful i am!
they will learn to respect me and know that i am holy.
they will see what i will do to you!’” 
this is what the lord god says: “at that time people will remember that i spoke about you in the past.
they will remember that i used my servants, the prophets of israel.
they will remember that the prophets of israel spoke for me in the past and said that i would bring you to fight against them.” 
the lord god said, “at that time gog will come to fight against the land of israel.
i will show my anger.
in my anger and strong emotions, i make this promise: i promise that there will be a strong earthquake in the land of israel.
at that time all living things will shake with fear.
the fish in the sea, the birds in the air, the wild animals in the fields, and all the little creatures crawling on the ground will shake with fear.
the mountains will fall down and the cliffs will break apart.
every wall will fall to the ground!” 
the lord god says, “on the mountains of israel, i will call for every kind of terror against gog.
his soldiers will be so afraid that they will attack each other and kill each other with their swords.
i will punish gog with diseases and death.
i will cause hailstones, fire, and sulfur to rain down on gog and his groups of soldiers from many nations.
then i will show how great i am.
i will prove that i am holy.
many nations will see me do these things, and they will learn who i am.
then they will know that i am the lord.
chapter 57.
all the good people are gone, and no one even noticed.
the loyal followers were gathered up, but no one knows why.
the reason they were gathered up is that trouble is coming.
but peace will come too, and those who trust him will get to rest in their own beds.
“come here, you children of witches.
your father committed adultery, and your mother was unfaithful.
you are children out of control, full of lies.
you make fun of me.
you make faces and stick out your tongue at me.
all you want is to worship false gods under every green tree.
you kill children by every stream and sacrifice them in the rocky places.
you love to worship the smooth rocks in the rivers.
you pour wine on them to worship them.
you give sacrifices to them, but those rocks are all you get.
do you think this makes me happy?
you make your bed on every hill and high mountain.
you go up to those places and offer sacrifices.
you hide the things that help you remember me behind the doors and doorframes.
you were with me, but you got up to go to them.
you spread out your bed and gave yourself to them.
you love their beds and enjoy looking at their naked bodies.
you use your oils and perfumes to look nice for molech.
you sent your messengers to faraway lands, and this will bring you down to the place of death.
all of them made you tired, but you never gave up.
you found new strength, because you enjoyed them.
you did not remember me.
you did not even notice me!
so who were you worrying about?
who were you afraid of?
why did you lie?
look, i have been quiet for a long time.
is that why you didn’t honor me?
i could tell about your ‘good works’ and all the ‘religious’ things you do, but that will not help you.
when you need help, you cry to those false gods that you have gathered around you.
let them help you!
but i tell you, the wind will blow them all away.
a puff of wind will blow them all away.
but the one who depends on me will get the land i promised and enjoy my holy mountain.” 
clear the road!
clear the road!
make the way clear for my people!
god is high and lifted up.
he lives forever.
his name is holy.
he says, “i live in a high and holy place, but i also live with people who are humble and sorry for their sins.
i will give new life to those who are humble in spirit.
i will give new life to those who are sorry for their sins.
i will not accuse my people forever.
i will not always be angry.
if i continued to show my anger, then the human spirit, the life i gave them, would die before me.
israel’s evil greed made me angry, so i punished them.
i turned away from them because i was angry.
but they continued to do wrong.
they did whatever they wanted.
i have seen their way of life, but i will heal them.
i will guide and comfort them and those who mourn for them.
i will teach them a new word: peace.
i will give peace to those who are near and to those who are far away.
i will heal them.” the lord himself said this.
but evil people are like the angry ocean.
they cannot be quiet and peaceful.
they are angry, and like the ocean, they stir up mud.
my god says, “there is no peace for evil people.” 
genesis.
chapter 15.
after all these things happened, the word of the lord came to abram in a vision.
god said, “abram, don’t be afraid.
i will defend you and give you a great reward.” 
but abram said, “lord god, there is nothing you can give me that will make me happy, because i have no son.
my slave eliezer from damascus will get everything i own after i die.” 
abram said, “you have given me no son, so a slave born in my house will get everything i have.” 
then the lord spoke to abram and said, “that slave will not be the one to get what you have.
you will have a son who will get everything you own.” 
then god led abram outside and said, “look at the sky.
see the many stars.
there are so many you cannot count them.
your family will be like that.” 
abram believed the lord, and because of this faith the lord accepted him as one who has done what is right.
he said to abram, “i am the lord who led you from ur of babylonia.
i did this so that i could give you this land.
you will own this land.” 
but abram said, “lord god, how can i be sure that i will get this land?” 
god said to abram, “we will make an agreement.
bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.” 
abram brought all these to god.
abram killed these animals and cut each of them into two pieces.
then he laid each half across from the other half.
he did not cut the birds into two pieces.
later, large birds flew down to eat the animals, but abram chased them away.
the sun began to go down and abram got very sleepy.
while he was asleep, a very terrible darkness came over him.
then the lord said to abram, “you should know this: your descendants will live in a country that is not their own.
they will be strangers there.
the people there will make them slaves and be cruel to them for 400 years.
but then i will punish the nation that made them slaves.
your people will leave that land, and they will take many good things with them.
“you yourself will live to be very old.
you will die in peace and will be buried with your family.
after four generations your people will come to this land again and defeat the amorites.
that will happen in the future because the amorites are not yet guilty enough to lose their land.” 
after the sun went down, it got very dark.
the dead animals were still on the ground, each animal cut into two pieces.
then a smoking firepot and a flaming torch passed between the halves of the dead animals.
so on that day the lord made a promise and an agreement with abram.
he said, “i will give this land to your descendants.
i will give them the land between the river of egypt and the great river euphrates.
this is the land of the kenites, kenizzites, kadmonites, 
hittites, perizzites, rephaites, 
amorites, canaanites, girgashites, and jebusites.” 
psalm.
chapter 129.
a song for going up to the temple.
all my life enemies have attacked me.
say it again, israel.
all my life enemies have attacked me, but they have never defeated me.
they beat me until i had deep cuts.
my back looked like a freshly plowed field.
but the lord does what is right; he cut the ropes and set me free from those wicked people.
may those who hate zion be put to shame.
may they be stopped and chased away.
they will be like grass on a flat roof that dies before it has time to grow.
the one who goes to harvest it will not find enough to cut and stack.
may no one walking by those wicked people ever say, “may the lord bless you!
we bless you in the name of the lord.” 
genesis.
chapter 48.
some time later joseph learned that his father was very sick.
so he took his two sons, manasseh and ephraim, and went to his father.
when joseph arrived, someone told israel, “your son joseph has come to see you.” israel was very weak, but he tried hard and sat up in his bed.
then israel said to joseph, “god all-powerful appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan.
god blessed me there.
he said to me, ‘i will make you a great family.
i will give you many children and you will be a great people.
your family will own this land forever.’ 
no branch can produce fruit alone.
it must stay connected to the vine.
it is the same with you.
you cannot produce fruit alone.
you must stay joined to me.
“i am the vine, and you are the branches.
if you stay joined to me, and i to you, you will produce plenty of fruit.
but separated from me you won’t be able to do anything.
if you don’t stay joined to me, you will be like a branch that has been thrown out and has dried up.
all the dead branches like that are gathered up, thrown into the fire and burned.
stay joined together with me, and follow my teachings.
if you do this, you can ask for anything you want, and it will be given to you.
show that you are my followers by producing much fruit.
this will bring honor to my father.
“i have loved you as the father has loved me.
now continue in my love.
i have obeyed my father’s commands, and he continues to love me.
in the same way, if you obey my commands, i will continue to love you.
i have told you these things so that you can have the true happiness that i have.
i want you to be completely happy.
this is what i command you: love each other as i have loved you.
the greatest love people can show is to die for their friends.
you are my friends if you do what i tell you to do.
i no longer call you servants, because servants don’t know what their master is doing.
but now i call you friends, because i have told you everything that my father told me.
“you did not choose me.
i chose you.
and i gave you this work: to go and produce fruit—fruit that will last.
then the father will give you anything you ask for in my name.
this is my command: love each other.
“if the world hates you, remember that they hated me first.
if you belonged to the world, the world would love you as it loves its own people.
but i have chosen you to be different from those in the world.
so you don’t belong to the world, and that is why the world hates you.
“remember the lesson i told you: servants are not greater than their master.
if people treated me badly, they will treat you badly too.
and if they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours too.
they will do to you whatever they did to me, because you belong to me.
they don’t know the one who sent me.
if i had not come and spoken to the people of the world, they would not be guilty of sin.
but now i have spoken to them.
so they have no excuse for their sin.
“whoever hates me also hates my father.
i did things among the people of the world that no one else has ever done.
if i had not done those things, they would not be guilty of sin.
but they have seen what i did, and still they hate me and my father.
but this happened to make clear the full meaning of what is written in their law: ‘they hated me for no reason.’ 
“i will send you the helper from the father.
the helper is the spirit of truth who comes from the father.
when he comes, he will tell about me.
and you will tell people about me too, because you have been with me from the beginning.
chapter 11.
there was a man named lazarus who was sick.
he lived in the town of bethany, where mary and her sister martha lived.
(mary is the same woman who put perfume on the lord and wiped his feet with her hair.)
mary’s brother was lazarus, the man who was now sick.
so mary and martha sent someone to tell jesus, “lord, your dear friend lazarus is sick.” 
when jesus heard this he said, “the end of this sickness will not be death.
no, this sickness is for the glory of god.
this has happened to bring glory to the son of god.” 
jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus.
so when he heard that lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days 
and then said to his followers, “we should go back to judea.” 
they answered, “but teacher, those jews there tried to stone you to death.
that was only a short time ago.
now you want to go back there?” 
jesus answered, “there are twelve hours of light in the day.
whoever walks in the day will not stumble and fall because they can see with the light from the sun.
but whoever walks at night will stumble because there is no light.” 
then jesus said, “our friend lazarus is now sleeping, but i am going there to wake him.” 
the followers answered, “but, lord, if he can sleep, he will get well.” 
they thought jesus meant that lazarus was literally sleeping, but he really meant that lazarus was dead.
so then jesus said plainly, “lazarus is dead.
and i am glad i was not there.
i am happy for you because now you will believe in me.
we will go to him now.” 
then thomas, the one called “twin,” said to the other followers, “we will go too.
we will die there with jesus.” 
jesus arrived in bethany and found that lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days.
bethany was about two miles from jerusalem.
many jews had come to see martha and mary.
they came to comfort them about their brother lazarus.
when martha heard that jesus was coming, she went out to greet him.
but mary stayed home.
martha said to jesus, “lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
but i know that even now god will give you anything you ask.” 
jesus said, “your brother will rise and be alive again.” 
martha answered, “i know that he will rise to live again at the time of the resurrection on the last day.” 
jesus said to her, “i am the resurrection.
i am life.
everyone who believes in me will have life, even if they die.
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never really die.
martha, do you believe this?” 
martha answered, “yes, lord.
i believe that you are the messiah, the son of god.
you are the one who was coming to the world.” 
after martha said these things, she went back to her sister mary.
she talked to mary alone and said, “the teacher is here.
he is asking for you.” 
when mary heard this, she stood up and went quickly to jesus.
he had not yet come into the village.
he was still at the place where martha met him.
the jews who were in the house comforting mary saw her get up and leave quickly.
they thought she was going to the tomb to cry there.
so they followed her.
mary went to the place where jesus was.
when she saw him, she bowed at his feet and said, “lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” 
when jesus saw mary crying and the people with her crying too, he was very upset and deeply troubled.
he asked, “where did you put him?” they said, “lord, come and see.” 
jesus cried.
and the jews said, “look!
he loved lazarus very much!” 
but some of them said, “jesus healed the eyes of the blind man.
why didn’t he help lazarus and stop him from dying?” 
again feeling very upset, jesus came to the tomb.
it was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance.
he said, “move the stone away.” martha said, “but, lord, it has been four days since lazarus died.
there will be a bad smell.” martha was the sister of the dead man.
then jesus said to her, “remember what i told you?
i said that if you believed, you would see god’s divine greatness.” 
so they moved the stone away from the entrance.
then jesus looked up and said, “father, i thank you that you heard me.
i know that you always hear me.
but i said these things because of the people here around me.
i want them to believe that you sent me.” 
after jesus said this he called in a loud voice, “lazarus, come out!” 
the dead man came out.
his hands and feet were wrapped with pieces of cloth.
he had a handkerchief covering his face.
jesus said to the people, “take off the cloth and let him go.” 
there were many jews who came to visit mary.
when they saw what jesus did, many of them believed in him.
but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what jesus did.
then the leading priests and pharisees called a meeting of the high council.
they said, “what should we do?
this man is doing many miraculous signs.
if we let him continue doing these things, everyone will believe in him.
then the romans will come and take away our temple and our nation.” 
one of the men there was caiaphas.
he was the high priest that year.
he said, “you people know nothing!
it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.
but you don’t realize this.” 
caiaphas did not think of this himself.
as that year’s high priest, he was really prophesying that jesus would die for the jewish people.
yes, he would die for the jewish people.
but he would also die for god’s other children scattered all over the world.
he would die to bring them all together and make them one people.
that day the jewish leaders began planning to kill jesus.
so jesus stopped traveling around openly among the jews.
he went away to a town called ephraim in an area near the desert.
he stayed there with his followers.
it was almost time for the jewish passover festival.
many people from the country went to jerusalem before the passover.
they went to do the special things to make themselves pure for the festival.
the people looked for jesus.
they stood in the temple area and asked each other, “is he coming to the festival?
what do you think?” 
but the leading priests and the pharisees had given a special order about jesus.
they said that anyone who knew where he was must tell them so that they could arrest him.
1 corinthians.
chapter 13.
i may speak in different languages, whether human or even of angels.
but if i don’t have love, i am only a noisy bell or a ringing cymbal.
i may have the gift of prophecy, i may understand all secrets and know everything there is to know, and i may have faith so great that i can move mountains.
but even with all this, if i don’t have love, i am nothing.
i may give away everything i have to help others, and i may even give my body as an offering to be burned.
but i gain nothing by doing all this if i don’t have love.
love is patient and kind.
love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud.
love is not rude, it is not selfish, and it cannot be made angry easily.
love does not remember wrongs done against it.
love is never happy when others do wrong, but it is always happy with the truth.
love never gives up on people.
it never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.
love will never end.
but all those gifts will come to an end—even the gift of prophecy, the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages, and the gift of knowledge.
these will all end because this knowledge and these prophecies we have are not complete.
but when perfection comes, the things that are not complete will end.
when i was a child, i talked like a child, i thought like a child, and i made plans like a child.
when i became a man, i stopped those childish ways.
it is the same with us.
now we see god as if we are looking at a reflection in a mirror.
but then, in the future, we will see him right before our eyes.
now i know only a part, but at that time i will know fully, as god has known me.
so these three things continue: faith, hope, and love.
and the greatest of these is love.
chapter 20.
i saw an angel coming down out of heaven.
the angel had the key to the bottomless pit.
the angel also held a large chain in his hand.
the angel grabbed the dragon, that old snake, also known as the devil or satan.
the angel tied the dragon with the chain for 1000 years.
then the angel threw the dragon into the bottomless pit and closed it.
the angel locked it over the dragon.
the angel did this so that the dragon could not trick the people of the earth until the 1000 years were ended.
after 1000 years the dragon must be made free for a short time.
then i saw some thrones and people sitting on them.
these were the ones who had been given the power to judge.
and i saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the truth of jesus and the message from god.
they did not worship the beast or its idol.
they did not receive the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands.
they came back to life and ruled with christ for 1000 years.
(the rest of the dead did not live again until the 1000 years were ended.)
this is the first resurrection.
great blessings belong to those who share in this first resurrection.
they are god’s holy people.
the second death has no power over them.
they will be priests for god and for christ.
they will rule with him for 1000 years.
when the 1000 years are ended, satan will be made free from his prison.
he will go out to trick the nations in all the earth, the nations known as gog and magog.
satan will gather the people for battle.
there will be more people than anyone can count, like sand on the seashore.
i saw satan’s army march across the earth and gather around the camp of god’s people and the city that god loves.
but fire came down from heaven and destroyed satan’s army.
and he (the one who tricked these people) was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet.
there they would be tortured day and night forever and ever.
then i saw a large white throne.
i saw the one who was sitting on the throne.
earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared.
and i saw those who had died, great and small, standing before the throne.
some books were opened.
and another book was opened—the book of life.
the people were judged by what they had done, which is written in the books.
the sea gave up the dead who were in it.
death and hades gave up the dead who were in them.
all these people were judged by what they had done.
and death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
this lake of fire is the second death.
and anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
chapter 2.
so do you think that you can judge those other people?
you are wrong.
you too are guilty of sin.
you judge them, but you do the same things they do.
so when you judge them, you are really condemning yourself.
god judges all who do such things, and we know his judgment is right.
and since you do the same things as those people you judge, surely you understand that god will punish you too.
how could you think you would be able to escape his judgment?
god has been kind to you.
he has been very patient, waiting for you to change.
but you think nothing of his kindness.
maybe you don’t understand that god is kind to you so that you will decide to change your lives.
but you are so stubborn!
you refuse to change.
so you are making your own punishment greater and greater.
you will be punished on the day when god will show his anger.
on that day everyone will see how right god is to judge people.
he will reward or punish everyone for what they have done.
some people live for god’s glory, for honor, and for life that cannot be destroyed.
they live for those things by always continuing to do good.
god will give eternal life to them.
but others are selfish and refuse to follow truth.
they follow evil.
god will show his anger and punish them.
he will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil—to the jews first and also to those who are not jews.
but he will give glory, honor, and peace to everyone who does good—to the jews first and also to those who are not jews.
god judges everyone the same.
it doesn’t matter who they are.
people who have the law and those who have never heard of the law are all the same when they sin.
people who don’t have the law and are sinners will be lost.
and, in the same way, those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law.
hearing the law does not make people right with god.
they will be right before him only if they always do what the law says.
those who are not jews don’t have the law.
but when they naturally do what the law commands without even knowing the law, then they are their own law.
this is true even though they don’t have the written law.
they show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong, the same as the law commands, and their consciences agree.
sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done wrong, and this makes them guilty.
and sometimes their thoughts tell them that they have done right, and this makes them not guilty.
all this will happen on the day when god will judge people’s secret thoughts through jesus christ.
this is part of the good news that i tell everyone.
what about you?
you say you are a jew.
you trust in the law and proudly claim to be close to god.
you know what god wants you to do.
and you know what is important, because you have learned the law.
you think you are a guide for people who don’t know the right way, a light for those who are in the dark.
you think you can show foolish people what is right.
and you think you are a teacher for those who are just beginning to learn.
you have the law, and so you think you know everything and have all truth.
you teach others, so why don’t you teach yourself?
you tell them not to steal, but you yourself steal.
you say they must not commit adultery, but you yourself are guilty of that sin.
you hate idols, but you steal them from their temples.
you are so proud that you have god’s law, but you bring shame to god by breaking his law.
as the scriptures say, “people in other nations insult god because of you.” 
if you follow the law, then your circumcision has meaning.
but if you break the law, then it is as if you were never circumcised.
those who are not jews are not circumcised.
but if they do what the law says, it is as if they were circumcised.
you have the written law and circumcision, but you break the law.
so those who are not circumcised in their bodies, but still obey the law, will show that you are guilty.
you are not a true jew if you are only a jew in your physical body.
true circumcision is not only on the outside of the body.
a true jew is one who is a jew inside.
true circumcision is done in the heart.
it is done by the spirit, not by the written law.
and anyone who is circumcised in the heart by the spirit gets praise from god, not from people.
chapter 2.
“write this to the angel of the church in ephesus: “here is a message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
“i know what you do, how hard you work and never give up.
i know that you don’t accept evil people.
you have tested those who say they are apostles but are not.
you found that they are liars.
you never stop trying.
you have endured troubles for my name and have not given up.
“but i have this against you: you have left the love you had in the beginning.
so remember where you were before you fell.
change your hearts and do what you did at first.
if you don’t change, i will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
but there is something you do that is right—you hate the things that the nicolaitans do.
i also hate what they do.
“everyone who hears this should listen to what the spirit says to the churches.
to those who win the victory i will give the right to eat the fruit from the tree of life, which is in god’s paradise.
“write this to the angel of the church in smyrna: “here is a message from the one who is the first and the last, the one who died and came to life again.
“i know your troubles, and i know that you are poor, but really you are rich!
i know the insults you have suffered from people who say they are jews.
but they are not true jews.
they are a group that belongs to satan.
don’t be afraid of what will happen to you.
i tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison.
he will do this to test you.
you will suffer for ten days, but be faithful, even if you have to die.
if you continue to be faithful, i will give you the reward of life.
“everyone who hears this should listen to what the spirit says to the churches.
those who win the victory will not be hurt by the second death.
“write this to the angel of the church in pergamum: “here is a message from the one who has the sharp two-edged sword.
“i know where you live.
you live where satan has his throne, but you are true to me.
you did not refuse to tell about your faith in me even during the time of antipas.
antipas was my faithful witness who was killed in your city, the city where satan lives.
“but i have a few things against you.
you have people there who follow the teaching of balaam.
balaam taught balak how to make the people of israel sin.
they sinned by eating food offered to idols and by committing sexual sins.
it is the same in your group.
you have people who follow the teaching of the nicolaitans.
so change your hearts!
if you don’t change, i will come to you quickly and fight against these people with the sword that comes out of my mouth.
“everyone who hears this should listen to what the spirit says to the churches!
“i will give the hidden manna to everyone who wins the victory.
i will also give each one a white stone that has a new name written on it.
and no one will know this name except the one who gets the stone.
“write this to the angel of the church in thyatira: “here is a message from the son of god, the one who has eyes that blaze like fire and feet like shining brass.
“i know what you do.
i know about your love, your faith, your service, and your patience.
i know that you are doing more now than you did at first.
but i have this against you: you let that woman jezebel do what she wants.
she says that she is a prophet, but she is leading my people away with her teaching.
jezebel leads my people to commit sexual sins and to eat food that is offered to idols.
i have given her time to change her heart and turn away from her sin, but she does not want to change.
“so i will throw her on a bed of suffering.
and all those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly.
i will do this now if they don’t turn away from the things she does.
i will also kill her followers.
then all the churches will see that i am the one who knows what people feel and think.
and i will repay each of you for what you have done.
“but others of you in thyatira have not followed her teaching.
you have not learned the things they call ‘satan’s deep secrets.’ this is what i say to you: i will not put any other burden on you.
only hold on to the truth you have until i come.
“i will give power over the nations to all those who win the victory and continue until the end to do what i want.
they will rule the nations with an iron rod.
they will break them to pieces like clay pots.
they will have the same power i received from my father, and i will give them the morning star.
everyone who hears this should listen to what the spirit says to the churches.
chapter 11.
then i was given a measuring rod as long as a walking stick.
i was told, “go and measure the temple of god and the altar, and count the people worshiping there.
but don’t measure the yard outside the temple.
leave it alone.
it has been given to those who are not god’s people.
they will show their power over the holy city for 42 months.
and i will give power to my two witnesses.
and they will prophesy for 1260 days.
they will be dressed in sackcloth.” 
these two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth.
if anyone tries to hurt the witnesses, fire comes from the mouths of the witnesses and kills their enemies.
anyone who tries to hurt them will die like this.
these witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying.
these witnesses have power to make the water become blood.
they have power to send every kind of plague to the earth.
they can do this as many times as they want.
when the two witnesses have finished telling their message, the beast will fight against them.
this is the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit.
it will defeat and kill them.
the bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city.
this city is named sodom and egypt.
these names for the city have a special meaning.
this is the city where the lord was killed.
people from every race of people, tribe, language, and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and a half days.
the people will refuse to bury them.
everyone on the earth will be happy because these two are dead.
they will have parties and send each other gifts.
they will do this because these two prophets brought much suffering to the people living on earth.
but after three and a half days, god let life enter the two witnesses again.
they stood on their feet.
all those who saw them were filled with fear.
then the two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven say, “come up here!” and both of them went up into heaven in a cloud.
their enemies watched them go.
at that same time there was a great earthquake.
a tenth of the city was destroyed.
and 7000 people were killed in the earthquake.
those who did not die were very afraid.
they gave glory to the god of heaven.
the second terror is now past.
the third terror is coming soon.
the seventh angel blew his trumpet.
then there were loud voices in heaven.
the voices said, “the kingdom of the world has now become the kingdom of our lord and of his messiah.
and he will rule forever and ever.” 
then the 24 elders bowed down on their faces and worshiped god.
these are the elders who sit on their thrones before god.
the elders said, “we give thanks to you, lord god all-powerful.
you are the one who is and who always was.
we thank you because you have used your great power and have begun to rule.
the people of the world were angry, but now is the time for your anger.
now is the time for the dead to be judged.
it is time to reward your servants, the prophets, and to reward your holy people, the people, great and small, who respect you.
it is time to destroy those people who destroy the earth!” 
then god’s temple in heaven was opened.
the box of the agreement could be seen in his temple.
then there were flashes of lightning, noises, thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.
chapter 22.
jesus used some more stories to teach the people.
he said, 
“god’s kingdom is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
he invited some people to the feast.
when it was ready, the king sent his servants to tell the people to come.
but they refused to come to the king’s feast.
“then the king sent some more servants.
he said to them, ‘i have already invited the people.
so tell them that my feast is ready.
i have killed my best bulls and calves to be eaten.
everything is ready.
come to the wedding feast.’ 
“but when the servants told the people to come, they refused to listen.
they all went to do other things.
one went to work in his field, and another went to his business.
some of the other people grabbed the servants, beat them, and killed them.
the king was very angry.
he sent his army to kill those who murdered his servants.
and the army burned their city.
“after that the king said to his servants, ‘the wedding feast is ready.
i invited those people, but they were not good enough to come to my feast.
so go to the street corners and invite everyone you see.
tell them to come to my feast.’ 
so the servants went into the streets.
they gathered all the people they could find, good and bad alike, and brought them to where the wedding feast was ready.
and the place was filled with guests.
“when the king came in to meet the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in the right clothes for a wedding.
the king said, ‘friend, how were you allowed to come in here?
you are not wearing the right clothes.’ but the man said nothing.
so the king told some servants, ‘tie this man’s hands and feet.
throw him out into the darkness, where people are crying and grinding their teeth with pain.’ 
“yes, many people are invited.
but only a few are chosen.” 
then the pharisees left the place where jesus was teaching.
they made plans to catch him saying something wrong.
they sent some men to jesus.
they were some of their own followers and some from the group called herodians.
they said, “teacher, we know you are an honest man.
we know you teach the truth about god’s way.
you are not afraid of what others think about you.
all people are the same to you.
so tell us what you think.
is it right to pay taxes to caesar or not?” 
but jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him.
so he said, “you hypocrites!
why are you trying to catch me saying something wrong?
show me a coin used for paying the tax.” they showed jesus a silver coin.
then he asked, “whose picture is on the coin?
and whose name is written on the coin?” 
they answered, “it is caesar’s picture and caesar’s name.” then jesus said to them, “give to caesar what belongs to caesar, and give to god what belongs to god.” 
when they heard what jesus said, they were amazed.
they left him and went away.
that same day some sadducees came to jesus.
(sadducees believe that no one will rise from death.)
the sadducees asked jesus a question.
they said, “teacher, moses told us that if a married man dies and had no children, his brother must marry the woman.
then they will have children for the dead brother.
there were seven brothers among us.
the first brother married but died.
he had no children.
so his brother married the woman.
then the second brother also died.
the same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers.
the woman was the last to die.
but all seven men had married her.
so when people rise from death, whose wife will she be?” 
jesus answered, “you are so wrong!
you don’t know what the scriptures say.
and you don’t know anything about god’s power.
at the time when people rise from death, there will be no marriage.
people will not be married to each other.
everyone will be like the angels in heaven.
surely you have read what god said to you about people rising from death.
god said, ‘i am the god of abraham, the god of isaac, and the god of jacob.’ so they were not still dead, because he is the god only of living people.” 
when the people heard this, they were amazed at jesus’ teaching.
the pharisees learned that jesus had made the sadducees look so foolish that they stopped trying to argue with him.
so the pharisees had a meeting.
then one of them, an expert in the law of moses, asked jesus a question to test him.
he said, “teacher, which command in the law is the most important?” 
jesus answered, “‘love the lord your god with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.’ 
this is the first and most important command.
and the second command is like the first: ‘love your neighbor the same as you love yourself.’ 
all of the law and the writings of the prophets take their meaning from these two commands.” 
so while the pharisees were together, jesus asked them a question.
he said, “what do you think about the messiah?
whose son is he?” the pharisees answered, “the messiah is the son of david.” 
jesus said to them, “then why did david call him ‘lord’?
david was speaking by the power of the spirit.
he said, 
‘the lord god said to my lord: sit by me at my right side, and i will put your enemies under your control.’ 
david calls the messiah ‘lord.’ so how can he be david’s son?” 
none of the pharisees could answer jesus’ question.
and after that day, no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions.
1 corinthians.
chapter 9.
i am a free man.
i am an apostle.
i have seen jesus our lord.
you people are an example of my work in the lord.
others may not accept me as an apostle, but surely you do.
you are proof that i am an apostle in the lord.
some people want to judge me.
so this is the answer i give them: 
we have the right to eat and drink, don’t we?
we have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel, don’t we?
the other apostles and the lord’s brothers and peter all do this.
and are barnabas and i the only ones who must work to earn our living?
no soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary.
no one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself.
no one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself.
these aren’t just my own thoughts.
god’s law says the same thing.
yes, it is written in the law of moses: “when a work animal is being used to separate grain, don’t keep it from eating the grain.” when god said this, was he thinking only about work animals?
he was really talking about us.
yes, that was written for us.
the one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work.
we planted spiritual seed among you, so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life.
surely that is not asking too much.
others have this right to get things from you.
so surely we have this right too.
but we don’t use this right.
no, we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the good news of christ.
surely you know that those who work at the temple get their food from the temple.
and those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar.
it is the same with those who have the work of telling the good news.
the lord has commanded that those who tell the good news should get their living from this work.
but i have not used any of these rights, and i am not trying to get anything from you.
that is not my purpose for writing this.
i would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride.
it’s not my work of telling the good news that gives me any reason to boast.
that is my duty—something i must do.
if i don’t tell people the good news, i am in real trouble.
if i did it because it was my own choice, i would deserve to be paid.
but i have no choice.
i must tell the good news.
so i am only doing the duty that was given to me.
so what do i get for doing it?
my reward is that when i tell people the good news i can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work.
i am free.
i belong to no other person, but i make myself a slave to everyone.
i do this to help save as many people as i can.
to the jews i became like a jew so that i could help save jews.
i myself am not ruled by the law, but to those who are ruled by the law i became like someone who is ruled by the law.
i did this to help save those who are ruled by the law.
to those who are without the law i became like someone who is without the law.
i did this to help save those who are without the law.
(but really, i am not without god’s law—i am ruled by the law of christ.)
to those who are weak, i became weak so that i could help save them.
i have become all things to all people.
i did this so that i could save people in any way possible.
i do all this to make the good news known.
i do it so that i can share in the blessings of the good news.
you know that in a race all the runners run, but only one runner gets the prize.
so run like that.
run to win!
all who compete in the games use strict training.
they do this so that they can win a prize—one that doesn’t last.
but our prize is one that will last forever.
so i run like someone who has a goal.
i fight like a boxer who is hitting something, not just the air.
it is my own body i fight to make it do what i want.
i do this so that i won’t miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it.
2 timothy.
chapter 4.
before god and jesus christ, i give you a command.
christ jesus is the one who will judge all people—those who are living and those who have died.
he is coming again to rule in his kingdom.
so i give you this command: 
tell everyone god’s message.
be ready at all times to do whatever is needed.
tell people what they need to do, tell them when they are doing wrong, and encourage them.
do this with great patience and careful teaching.
the time will come when people will not listen to the true teaching.
but people will find more and more teachers who please them.
they will find teachers who say what they want to hear.
people will stop listening to the truth.
they will begin to follow the teaching in false stories.
but you should control yourself at all times.
when troubles come, accept them.
do the work of telling the good news.
do all the duties of a servant of god.
my life is being given as an offering for god.
the time has come for me to leave this life here.
i have fought the good fight.
i have finished the race.
i have served the lord faithfully.
now, a prize is waiting for me—the crown that will show i am right with god.
the lord, the judge who judges rightly, will give it to me on that day.
yes, he will give it to me and to everyone else who is eagerly looking forward to his coming.
do your best to come to me as soon as you can.
demas loved this world too much.
that is why he left me.
he went to thessalonica.
crescens went to galatia.
and titus went to dalmatia.
luke is the only one still with me.
get mark and bring him with you when you come.
he can help me in my work here.
i sent tychicus to ephesus.
when i was in troas, i left my coat there with carpus.
so when you come, bring it to me.
also, bring my books.
the books written on parchment are the ones i need.
alexander the metalworker caused me so much harm.
the lord will punish him for what he did.
he fought against everything we teach.
you should be careful that he doesn’t hurt you too.
the first time i defended myself, no one helped me.
everyone left me.
i pray that god will forgive them.
but the lord stayed with me.
the lord gave me strength so that i could tell the good news everywhere.
he wanted all those who are not jews to hear that good news.
so i was saved from the lion’s mouth.
the lord will save me when anyone tries to hurt me.
he will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom.
glory forever and ever be the lord’s.
give my greetings to priscilla and aquila and to the family of onesiphorus.
erastus stayed in corinth.
and i left trophimus in miletus—he was sick.
try as hard as you can to come to me before winter.
greetings to you from eubulus, pudens, linus, claudia, and all the brothers and sisters here.
the lord be with your spirit.
grace be with you.
