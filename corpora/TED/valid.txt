how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?
now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.
since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference, since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us, it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work.
but what it would mean and who would survive?
you can't get an exact number for that kind of probability, but what i'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening.
there's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer.
and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information.
in that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do -- and i mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast.
so you have to be tenth floor or higher, or in the basement.
and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in.
how do we search for alien life if it's nothing like the life that we know?
so i have a strange career.
i'm going to tell you about how i learned something about life.
but it was an exciting experience.
and that came as a surprise to me, because i was actually hired to work on quantum computation.
and then you see something like that.
so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things -- so this particular person wrote a whole article and said, "hey, these are bacteria."
maybe i do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction.
well how would you go about it?
and then you might get something.
and then you might come up with something like this.
and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts.
and if you take a look at that, this was actually in a book that i wrote that deals with artificial life.
and it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses.
so having seen this work, worked a little bit on this, this is where i came in.
but what is this system like?
well i can't really go into the details, but what you see here is some of the entrails.
and as you see here, there are groups that are growing on top of each other, because they are spreading.
and we put them in, and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation.
so you see waves of new types taking over the other types.
so what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way we're used to life [going.]
and the thing i came up with -- i have to first give you an introduction about the idea, and maybe that would be a meaning detector, rather than a life detector.
and i would like to do it in such a way that i don't actually have to be able to read the language, because i'm sure i won't be able to.
well it turns out, we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks.
and some other ones that are not used in the set of 20, they will not appear at all in any type of concentration.
they have about 28 of these instructions.
so they are either poisonous or really should be used at less of a level than random.
and now what i did there is, i was being nasty, i just turned up the heat again and again.
what do we learn from that?
well, i think we learn a number of things from that.
we can make life in the computer.
life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets.
and if we remove the mystery of life, then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live, and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are.
and on the other side there was a rising sun.
there are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side.
and i think that's one of the main problems of our society.
we have to keep everything under control.
we want to go in a direction, but the winds push us in another direction, like in life.
by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction.
but how do we do that?
how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day?
and i think in life it should be exactly like this.
the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas, because new ideas are so easy to have.
we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas.
life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension.
life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions.
i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid -- if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.
but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it.
and when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed.
go down immediately in order to slow down."
and he told me, "yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole.
you want to go very fast in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?
and this is why you need weathermen.
we could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.
but if i show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were.
i had no idea how it was possible.
i just thought it's a dream and i want to do it.
it allowed to do all those things there.
but it will not be possible in the future any more.
if we want to show the potential, we have to fly day and night.
that means to load the batteries during the flight, in order to spend the night on the batteries, and fly the next day again.
we have now 70 people in the team working on it.
you cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision, it's a real airplane.
the same time we load the batteries, we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height, we arrive at the beginning of the night.
a little bit like on this picture here.
what pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood.
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team.
and each time we have some ice in the future, we have to know that life will be great, and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice, to go through the obstacle, to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.
the question i leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard?
which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life, to get to the success that you wish to have, to get to the point that really belongs to you, with the potential you have, and the one you can really fulfill?
but metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.
but whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else, we give it a whole network of analogies too.
the first step is pattern recognition.
people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters.
what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed.
you can take the test now.
the test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.
they took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.
pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.
a group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the u.s.
and they had to make a decision.
and the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.
but you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it.
but there is a better translation.
i just really want to thank you very much.
my lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country.
and though i'm a rock star, i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.
but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players.
from the ease with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged.
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.
we lived in ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.
the children had a name for me.
in that moment, i became the worst thing of all: i became a rock star with a cause.
the right to live like a human.
the next thing i'd like to be clear about is what this problem is, and what this problem isn't.
because this is not all about charity.
there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa.
and deep down, if we really accepted that africans were equal to us, we would all do more to put the fire out.
i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror, it could be soon.
"the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."
now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone, maybe we should listen.
never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.
these things are under attack around the world.
what on earth can we all do about this?
but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.
this room was born for this moment, is really what i want to say to you tonight.
it is a pain in the arse.
i do not have flowers in my hair.
and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast, there was muscle to the movement that started out here.
it's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot, but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world.
we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer acceptable.
this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet earth.
this year is a test for us all, especially the leaders of the g8 nations, who really are on the line here, with all the world in history watching.
they started out with such promise on africa.
but some of them they haven't.
what i try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree, is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it.
so this is what i hope that you will do, if i could be so bold, and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.
i think they just have one idea in their mind, which is, where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world.
when the history books get written, i think our age will be remembered for three things.
and what we did or did not do to put out the fires in africa.
i should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.
most of them impossible, some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral.
we just need your help in making it happen.
we can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.
we will have the ear of congress.
i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day.
please join us by working together.
please visit one at this address.
and i would like it to be ethiopia.
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.
the average waiting time to get a landline in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years.
and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference.
thank you very much once again.
and i would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in yemen.
this picture shows a revolution started by women, and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest.
the other picture is the popularity of the real need for change.
is it going to be so many different countries?
is it going to be another somalia?
and they do, in many ways, tell a different story than the story of yemen, the one that is often in the news.
how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper, especially in such times of conflict?
in yemen, most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life.
i wish i could show you my yemen.
and i was privileged because i was born into a family, my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.
he would say we are equal.
and even my mother -- i owe it to my family.
and in my third year, i started becoming confused because i was yemeni, but i was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college.
and that is something i will keep in my heart forever.
so since then i've been the bridge, and a lot of people have walked over me.
it was very hard at first.
and in the first year, i had to fire half of the men.
it's about proving who you are and what you can do.
and i want to score a point here, because my husband is in the room over there.
pm: and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper.
so how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you?
and a lot of it is because women are not able, are not free, to show their face to their self.
and the more empowered the women become, the more they are able to remove the veil, for example, or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel.
and i have done this throughout my work.
we started with, you can take it off in the office.
and then after that, you can take it off on assignments.
and i am a role model in yemen.
a lot of people look up to me.
a lot of young girls look up to me.
you can be yourself and have your face.
and it definitely does give a different image of yemen.
you spoke about the responsibility of the press.
and certainly, when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger, often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding, how do you see the way that the western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular, in your country?
i think yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years.
but after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay, we are going to stand up again on our feet, but in the new yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic.
and certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for.
i went to see this specialist, and she was top-of-the-field and told me i had to stop singing.
i could barely stand up without feeling like i was going to faint.
no one wants to go on flolan.
he was a big figure in all of our lives, and we loved him very much.
but soon i was showing signs of right-heart failure, and i had to return to sea level, doing so knowing that i probably would never see my home again.
i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face, and in the heat of the desert, i was freezing cold.
i fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where i found my problem: i had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine.
i started mixing, and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another, but i just kept on going.
my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.
i had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries.
i was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon, and i asked him if i needed a transplant, what i could do to prepare.
a happy patient is a healthy patient."
i finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice.
it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match.
i flew to cleveland, and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye.
the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket, telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again, and to please try and save my voice.
they left my chest open for two weeks.
if they stayed in, there was no way i would ever sing again.
he said it would kill me.
my parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place, but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.
this past summer, when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the colorado rockies, i couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that i couldn't sing.
and i wanted to tell her, and i want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams.
and some of us might even sing.
so it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is.
and i have to take a little bit of artistic license.
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat.
but for the men here, i want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk.
and many of these workers have life expectancies of only 50.
it shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us, just like rachel carson and others have warned.
you would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it.
and i kept thinking over and over again this question.
we know what we're putting out there, we have a sense of those repercussions, but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things, or things are put into our bodies.
and it's my feeling and it's my urging being here to know that, as we women move forward as the communicators of this, but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children, bearing the children, we hold most of the buying power in the household, is that it's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world.
i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem, so on coastal clean-up day in 2005 i went to the long beach peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.
i thought i would spend 20 bucks.
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean, at the base of the food chain, was ingesting these poison pills.
we have to throw it away.
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.
i'm not sure if i had any impact on the one-day strike, but what i do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.
it took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback.
so 60 seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel.
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook.
and that goes for every single person in this room.
and that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes, so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.
and we had to deal with images that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.
and it turned out to be true.
and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source, and in this case, these guys were new york food bloggers.
and that was the job of the journalist.
and a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the egyptian revolution in 2011.
and how do you build a list like that from scratch?
so we set about going to work on this video, and the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the youtube account.
so we looked all over the u.s.
so we went back to the video, and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.
so we were able to call rita, clear the video, make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
so that was the only one that gave us a clue.
so the river is flowing south to north.
so we go a bit further.
so this could be our bridge.
and we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge.
so what does that tell me?
given a couple of clues, i could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.
i'm going to ask you to imagine what a redwood really is as a living organism.
that is to say, at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees.
he would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.
you use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.
humans appear to be the only primates that i know of that are afraid of heights.
looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us.
we had been visited in the night by flying squirrels, who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before.
you do feel a sense of exposure.
there is a small person right down there on the ground.
i asked steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.
and if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us, and they would have people on their hands and so on.
and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time.
flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time.
they also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
we're looking at the very top of gaya, which is thought to be the oldest redwood.
as you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.
i climbed there this past summer.
well, i think they can tell us something about human time.
and i was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.
think about everything it has brought us.
so let me show you something.
we know because it says so inside the code.
and i knocked on the door.
so here standing up is basit.
sitting down is his brother amjad.
i asked them how they feel about what they started.
so there is some sort of justice in the world after all.
so let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like.
so let me just mount some drives.
what we have here is a list of old viruses.
let me show you one which actually makes some sound.
so where are all these coming from then?
every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
they are both right now on the run.
and that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks.
let me give you an example.
but just keep staring at it.
how do i know about this car?
he actually had a car accident.
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the mercedes is o600ko78rus.
and even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome.
and this is what runs our infrastructure.
this is what runs everything around us.
because everything around us is being run by these.
everything is being run by computers.
and this really is something which creates completely new problems for us.
we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.
think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another.
i see beauty in the future of the internet, but i'm worried that we might not see that.
online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.
we have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now.
what actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven't yet done it.
now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising, because i'm not engaged in the business of magic.
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict, and there are some that it can't.
i actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.
and they have beliefs about what other people want, and what other people don't want, how much power other people have, how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.
a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?
that is, they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest.
now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests, we have to think about who has influence in the world.
and many of you may have noticed that doesn't have as big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.
each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them, so they can advise the president.
imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.
now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head.
suppose we double the number of influencers from five to 10.
so, what do we need to know in order to predict?
you may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.
we need to know what they say they want, not what they want in their heart of hearts, not what they think they can get, but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position, and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.
we need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand.
and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue?
most people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior.
how they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.
so where are we going to get this information?
how are things going for him?
how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?
you take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.
i want to be very clear here.
he is on the way down.
and if you engineer what they do you can change the world, you can get a better result.
i love that you put it out there.
it would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement, and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.
so it would be a good thing.
bbm: well, people of iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want, and we could get there a lot sooner, and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions, and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end, and the world would be a better place.
because how did you learn language?
you didn't learn it by just learning principles, you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.
i want to know why you do what you do.
or are you running the same pattern?
all of us here have great minds.
we can -- i agree with what was described a few days ago, about this idea that people work in their self-interest.
and so it's wonderful for us to think intellectually about how the life of the world is, and especially those who are very smart -- we can play this game in our head.
and what i would like to maybe invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons.
what makes the difference in their performance?"
and i've got to do something right now to get the result or nothing matters.
but i haven't done it, and the reason is an understanding of these human needs that i want to talk to you about.
how do you make a change?
you can only feel so much by yourself.
you were there to comfort them.
and what i mean by that is the mindset that we are our past.
and of course it does if you live there.
but, how easy for me to tell him what he should do.
and the way that it came across to some people on that day -- because i know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't, and i was upset.
and if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything.
but this is not the story that people tell us, right?
the story people tell us is a bunch of different stories.
is this the end or the beginning?
how many can think about it?
tr: so the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there.
what if they made that decision versus to build their own culture?
how would the world be different?
how would their lives be different?
the history of our world is these decisions.
or someone standing in front of a tank.
what am i going to do?
your model of the world is what shapes you long term.
your model of the world is the filter.
you can get your desires or goals.
how many have ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?
i believe there are six human needs.
let me tell you what they are.
everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable.
how many of you here love surprises?
you can get it by making more money.
you can do it by being more spiritual.
you can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know.
even if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities.
but the last two needs -- the first four needs are called the needs of the personalities, is what i call it -- the last two are the needs of the spirit.
we all know the answer here.
and the reason we grow, i believe, is so we have something to give of value.
and that calling can touch other people.
my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up.
i know what they were briefly.
the time was one of the most painful experiences of life.
my three decisions gave me a different path.
and what that made me decide is, if strangers care about me and my family, i care about them.
what am i going to do?
it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families.
the most fun thing i ever did in my life, the most moving.
then next year i did four.
so sure enough, i went out and what did i do?
i got my friends involved and i grew companies and then i got 11 companies and i built the foundation.
the second piece is the map.
think of that as the operating system that tells you how to get there.
they want to honor god or honor their family, but they have a different map.
and there are seven different beliefs.
well, imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go?
and half of those make them feel like shit.
how many of you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off?
and then i went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going to get off this island, if nine days from now you were going to die, who would you call, what would you say, what would you do?
what does this mean and what are we going to do?"
there are people -- then one woman got up and she was so angry and screaming and yelling.
and i took these two men and did what i call an indirect negotiation.
jewish man with family in the occupied territory, someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and made it very clear.
i hope this was of service.
they want to teach me about my destiny.
it will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance.
and it will take all of you.
it will take all of you."
it's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old.
he saw that first glint of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.
the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot.
we cannot afford to lose it.
this i know intimately, because even as i travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them, i struggle.
i am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains.
and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way.
this whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable.
the system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match.
and all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification.
so we have to manage many claims to the same video.
but the system only works through the participation of rights owners.
just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology.
and i think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.
and so i go in there until the early hours of the morning, and i work on new songs.
but i know where she was.
she was with me on my lifeboat.
so i really consider myself a storyteller.
i do this because i think that people actually have a lot in common.
i think people are very similar, but i also think that we have trouble seeing that.
you know, as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps, and i think we all see a lot of gaps.
and i think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves.
i think this is a very old human desire.
but the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen.
what's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities, these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the internet.
so this is we feel fine.
and we see here, "i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected.
each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
that was from someone in michigan.
we see people in their twenties are the most prolific, followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties, and it dies out very quickly from there.
and if i hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
and then if i go over here, the list begins to scroll, and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
what i mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives.
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories.
you know, as a child in vermont, on a farm where i grew up, i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of orion, the hunter.
and it caused me to wonder about our world today.
what are the great stories of today?
so you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.
and i can turn them all on, and you can see them moving across the sky now.
we can actually click anything in universe and have it become the center of the universe, and everything else will enter its orbit.
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe.
we can see the stories that bill clinton is taking part in right now.
any of those can be opened up.
you can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit.
you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source.
we can also see the superstars.
we can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of bill clinton in the last week or so.
and then we can also see a timeline.
so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday, but he was back to work on sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week.
here we have our star field.
as you search for the things that are important to you in your world, and then see what the constellations of those might look like.
and let me step back in time.
let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.
and this is what we have to deal with.
so we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.
so what we do is that we put all these slices together.
imagine that you slice your body in all these directions, and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data, into a block of data.
so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at.
i want to look at the heart.
i want to look at the blood vessels.
i want to look at the liver.
so this is where this little dear comes into play.
this is as of 9 a.m.
so i'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.
and of course all the data is inside, so i can start rotating, i can look at it from different angles, and i can see that this woman had a problem.
so in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning, the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners.
and then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.
and the cause of death is the broken neck.
and this women also ended up under the car, so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury.
and this is also again showing us what we can do.
during a physical autopsy, if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments, that's actually quite hard to do.
it actually looks like this, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like.
it really just works like a huge iphone.
so if you were thinking of buying an ipad, forget about it.
this is what you want instead.
this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now, but i hope they will in the future.
so what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.
so i can feel the skin.
then he can examine how the heart is moving.
so he could actually see things in the goggles.
so i could present things to him while he's in the scanner.
and then he can see that at the same time.
we can do this in real time.
we can tell him to do things.
and he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things.
now we're also having a bit of fun at the center.
so she came to the center, and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner.
i can look inside of it.
and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology, because there's very little known about the animal anatomy.
the only problem is to fit it into the machine.
it was kind of hard to get it in.
so be aware of the bear.
my motto is always, i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am.
it was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.
so i thought i'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life.
both were very young countries then, and full of hope for the future.
but there was one little boy, very small for his age.
he was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.
and many experiences like this happened to me.
another one is that i met a miner.
and you know what it was?
we can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.
well, i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.
and if they collide, it would look a lot like the big bang.
and in this scenario, not only was the big bang not the beginning, as you can see from the picture, it can happen over and over again.
and then there are deaths from war.
they were the only other couple.
and the idea was very simple.
they want to be the next einstein.
and we got lots of applicants.
five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the u.s.
so here you can see behind this list.
so here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green.
we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims.
my understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.
so all in all i have a very good ph.d.
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture.
and our plan is quite simple.
easy to remember the basic rules we need.
you could play games with it.
and i thought to myself, this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system.
the net is doing the work in the brain.
if you just look at these two pictures, these kind of words pop into your mind.
and i'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.
and the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.
and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network.
when you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.
let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano, ok.
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.
i was coming at it from a different perspective, where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem.
so, my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole.
i'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive, what we like to call "supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.
and the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist.
so, to begin with, we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole.
so why is it so important?
it's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole.
and it's actually quite a useful concept, because it tells us not only when a black hole will form, but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.
and your job today is to be skeptical.
so, i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is, as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life.
almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.
and there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale.
so, what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to.
so, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies.
and if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy; what we see is the star light.
and this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the milky way.
and what we see is a line of stars.
which is the job that i have to show you today.
and the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole.
so, i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.
because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
so, this means that i want to see a lot of detail.
and that is because of the atmosphere.
and to give you a sense of how short that is, the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.
and this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.
what we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle.
you can see a lot of stars.
so, there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, because you could put a lot of stuff in there.
i have told you my job is to get it down to the schwarzchild radius.
so, what i want to tell you, very briefly, is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is, or at least we believe, that there is a supermassive black hole there.
what you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole.
you should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.
a black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
and what does the big black hole do?
it pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart.
we do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere, and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest.
so this is what we hope to do in the next few years.
and with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.
and this means that these things do exist in our universe, and we have to contend with this, we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world.
and we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast, and holds a lot in store for the future.
and for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
both my parents really loved it.
and i think inspired by that memory, it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can, sort of pass it on through whatever means.
and he ran around the bases.
how did he get to hear mozart?
and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive.
now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord, even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room.
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise god.
and by the 1400s, music was being written that tried to mirror god's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky.
this was truly the music of the spheres.
so the big difference between human happiness and sadness?
a piece like beethoven's fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger, over the course of a half an hour, step by exacting step of his route, to the moment when he could make it across to joy.
what happens when the music stops?
what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?
and how might that change their lives?
people could now hear music all the time, even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.
well let me show you a story of what i mean by "really sticking with us."
i was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home, and i spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker.
and i thought, my god, how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room to recover the memory of this music that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away, still means so much to him?
i never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life.
and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.
sure, the big events attract a lot of attention, but what really matters is what goes on every single day.
and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind, and it can do amazing things.
so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.
i'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.
and al gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets, and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years, we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.
so this is the dawn of the new age of kites.
as you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.
it makes you a little nauseous.
but audacious is what has happened many times before in history.
so really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams.
and i think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things.
and for ted, it means the dawn of a whole new chapter ...
and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.
you can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel.
and the first thing you need is ... a crowd, a group of people who share a common interest.
the second thing you need is light.
you need clear, open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of, because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate.
moment that changes the world is misleading.
why do people like watching tedtalks?
all those ideas are already out there in print.
they can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.
what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors, instead of net plunderers?
but the good news is they are out there.
i mean, is it crazy to think that this girl, in the back, at the right, in 15 years, might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren?
there are so many good things which are happening right here in kibera.
they turned a trash place into a garden.
they used the same trash to form green manure.
change happens when we see things in a different way.
and the song that i just played was by józef hofmann.
i have another piece that i'd like to play for you.
that comes from the last name of one of schumann's female friends.
but he wrote that for his wife.
now comes the part that i hate.
i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.
they help me plan out the whole piece, and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.
and then you want to decide, how are you going to draw the character?
am i going to draw it on the computer?
you feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.
jl: would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?
but other than that, talk until they drag you off the stage.
now i hope you enjoy the session.
david cameron: the next age of government
the first is this: we believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives, if you give people more choice, if you put them in the driving seat, then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.
the second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.
politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are, rather than as they would like them to be.
now, why do i think now is the moment to make this argument?
couldn't actually turn back very much, because if you were king a thousand years ago, while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country, there wasn't much you were in charge of.
you could just about go to war and that was about it.
it was able to do that itself.
just consider this one fact: one hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.
well i can't, in the time i've got, give huge numbers of examples, but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.
and this is so obvious, in a way, because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.
you can see what crime is committed where, and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.
now i also said the other principle that i think we should work on is understanding of people, is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more.
let me just give you one example that i think is incredibly simple, and i love.
the best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending, to show them what their neighbors are spending, and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.
how do we make it happen?
so what does all this add up to?
but when he made that speech, what could you do to build the stronger, better society?
and i think an even more wonderful speech, which i'm going to read a big chunk of, which sums up what i said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money, and more that we should try and measure than money.
so who gets to do it?
putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are.
none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next.
the only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world, there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were.
let me take you on a little tour.
we work in groups, in big cities — — and in small villages.
then we like to take things apart.
let me show you what you could do right now.
you can do a lot of things.
it just has to follow safety guidelines.
if everyone in this room got involved, who knows what we could do?
how can we fit more people into cities without overcrowding?
i thought i would start with a very brief history of cities.
life was very small for most people.
health care took place in hospitals.
and we still live in that world, and this is what we end up with.
and we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not.
more than half the people now in the world live in cities, and that will just continue to escalate.
that's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly.
so this is my image of the city of the future.
maybe not the way people dress, but -- you know, the question now is, how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities without all the bad things?
it took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in bangalore last year.
so we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars.
we actually did exactly the wrong thing in boston.
but shared use is really key.
we got rid of all the useless things like engines and transmissions.
actually we could do this today.
we hope to have that built this fall.
i think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it.
so if you can have folding and autonomy, you can do that in one seventh of the space.
maybe a third — and you see everybody has their back to the wall and they have food and coffee down the way and they're in their own little personal bubble.
we have to get this right.
they might weigh up to two tons.
some say up to five tons.
so they were very important, and they were important for the oil out of their liver.
you get gallons of oil from their liver.
and that oil was used especially for lighting, but also for dressing wounds and other things.
and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland, string it out along the other net.
it would often drown and suffocate.
or at times, they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck.
they used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks.
maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
we know very little about them.
and most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface.
half the challenge is to get access, is to be in the right place at the right time.
one is to try and work out the gender of the shark.
and this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water.
and you see that this work was done in 2006.
do you remember how many they killed off achill there in the 70s and the 50s?
they even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told this was illegal.
and they actually did get a fine for that.
and i remembered -- i used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -- i remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind.
so i was thinking that must have come from the shark.
all it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong.
there was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
and they sat on it for months actually.
anyway he thought he'd better do it, because i never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing i sent him.
and he was amazed that they actually got dna from the slime.
and so he was all very excited.
and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind.
but hey, sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come.
so we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples.
so you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
and they are caught and they are on the market.
you want to learn as much as you can.
and you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
so as i said, these things are sent to you in strange ways.
and keep an eye out for sharks.
so thank you and thank you for listening.
philip zimbardo knows how easy it is for nice people to turn bad.
then he talks about the flip side: how easy it is to be a hero, and how we can rise to the challenge.
interestingly, i asked this question when i was a little kid.
and i had friends who were really good kids, who lived out the dr.
if you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels.
and that tells us several things.
he didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.
and these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation.
but how am i going to -- how am i going to deal with that hypothesis?
and what i've done is i organized them into various categories.
those are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted.
that prisoner covered himself with shit every day, and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink.
what was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?
so how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character, if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon?
who are the cast of characters?
the power is in the system.
and this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.
what do the people bring into the situation?
what does the situation bring out of them?
and the good news story that i'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes.
there's a study some of you think you know about, but very few people have ever read the story.
and so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people.
we want men between 20 and 50."
so, you go down, and one of you is going to be a learner, and one of you is going to be a teacher.
all evil starts with 15 volts.
and then the next step is another 15 volts.
and the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?
they could not be more wrong.
and secondly, we know there's no difference between the boys who are going to be guards and the boys who are going to be prisoners.
we didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.
it was a real cop car, it was a real policeman, and there were real neighbors in the street, who didn't know that this was an experiment.
then they put me in a cell.
i was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell, which was just like a room with a door with bars on it.
philip zimbardo: here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized.
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity.
my guards did it in five days.
the study ended after six days, because it was out of control.
the key is in the red zone.
those abuses went on for three months.
he gave the guards permission to do those things, and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.
that means that line is not out there.
so i want to end very quickly on a positive note.
they had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him, and then his mother and his wife.
when i said it got out of control, i was the prison superintendent.
and i ended the study the next day.
the good news is i married her the next year.
and so one day, you will be in a new situation.
so the point is thinking it and then doing it.
so i want to thank you.
the wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind.
we recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence, yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create.
and there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it; we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.
and this is a person who is alive.
this is not a person that is being studied at autopsy.
and we could take a very simple view and say, well, it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams, or when we go under anesthesia, and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia.
but there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room.
we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now.
and we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this -- not the person who is sitting next to you.
so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.
everything is nice and fine and perpendicular.
and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory, out of those association cortices, and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception.
and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image-making when we recall information.
so let me tell you just a little bit about how i came to this.
and so that is a beginning.
so what is the picture that we get here?
only the wealth of our minds is, not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence, and that we have any sense of person.
you have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non-serendipitous way if you do not know how this works.
so i was born on the last day of the last year of the '70s.
i was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy.
you can see how this had an influence.
my dad actually resigned from the male-only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.
i thought they were really hot.
these are three words many of us were raised with.
which brings me to my third paradox.
i did what i know to do in desperation, which is write.
i wrote the book i needed to read.
i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work.
so she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact.
what i learned from these people and others was that i couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.
but how good a failure is it?"
on one, we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part.
i was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even.
and we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves.
but on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind, what are we really achieving?
is this how we feel about the pressures of our world, that in order to get inside ourselves, you have to run for the hills?
and the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home eventually.
so my question to you is, can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape?
i say the answer is yes.
let me show you what it looks like.
that blue line there is my brainwave.
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am, so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side.
i'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit, but first i want to take a look at how we got here.
we were making things activate, light up and work just by thinking.
and then we were asked to do something really big for the olympics.
over 17 days at the olympics 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the c.n.
we realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you.
that you could know something about yourself.
we could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden.
let me show you an example of what i'm talking about here.
so you use it with your headset.
and this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves.
i like to call this "intra-active."
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight.
do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk?
would you make more time for those people?
they knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase, when you come into contact with yourself.
i look forward to the day that i can sit beside you, easel-side, watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves.
can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were 17?
do you know what i wanted to be?
because they were all about being free, the wind in your hair -- just to be free.
not that we could have afforded i drive, but to give me the dream of driving.
because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters.
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun.
and you know, how on earth did i get to 17 and not know that?
and what the hell does that mean to you?
so let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?
i might buy some more time.
beyond this hand is a world of vaseline.
and they decided to tell me that i could see.
the first thing i thought about was my mom, who was crying over beside me.
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face.
and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive.
and i believed i could do it.
and then i was a masseuse.
and then i went to business school.
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999, saying something i never imagined that i would say.
and you all know what it is.
we all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure.
have you ever tried to see that if you have vaseline in front of your eyes?
and i had no idea that this man was going to change my life.
i had no idea who i was anymore.
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself?
and then he said to me, "what did you want to be when you were little?"
hardly appropriate at this moment in time.
he thought i was mad enough anyway.
i think it's time to stop fighting and do something different."
and i had no idea where i was going.
really not a very sensible thing to do.
and i went on a run that i know so well.
i know this run so well, by the back of my hand.
and there was a rock that i always missed.
and i sat there for quite some time going, "how am i going to get off this rock and go home?
because who am i going to be?
what am i going to be?"
and i kept thinking over and over in my mind, what had happened?
and now i had lost it.
what do you want to be?
what did you want to be when you were little?
do you love what you do?
what do you want to be?
what do you want to be?"
and it did happen this way.
i know how to be mowgli.
and i had no idea how i was going to be an elephant handler.
i had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.
six thousand people got to see because of that.
when i came home off that elephant, do you know what the most amazing part was?
it just seemed that it was possible.
and the one thing is that a really good friend of mine, he texted me on the way over, knowing i was scared.
and if you truly believe -- and i mean believe from the bottom of your heart -- you can make change happen.
we all have to be included.
there are a lot of ways you can describe this.
and your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
these will be places that are not worth caring about.
and i want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like iraq, spilling their blood in the sand, and ask yourself, "what is their last thought of home?"
we need better places in this country.
this is a good public space.
the beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out, and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
but this is how we do it in the united states.
and every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt i.m.
this is the other side of the building.
because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
that -- that is the message of this form of architecture.
so the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
we have to do good buildings.
those are the four jobs of the street trees.
you know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
and we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city, which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
and so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century, is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city, which is going to be life in the country for everybody.
i don't have any eyes on the side of my head.
these are not good enough for americans.
we're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.
we're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
and we should have started two days before yesterday.
we can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in america.
the dead malls: what are we going to do with them?
and by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites.
be prepared to be good neighbors.
be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.
and we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face.
please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.
it all started with a crazy idea in november of 2004.
but soon the idea began spreading virally.
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards.
what i'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection, starting with this one.
"i found these stamps as a child, and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to.
maybe one of you sent this one in.
this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you.
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos.
he pays me a lot to keep it a secret."
it was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.
and i tried to act calm, not to give anything away.
and just like every sunday, we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
he said, "but this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one."
and when she saw him, he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
it was a very happy ending.
this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it, but this secret has impacted many lives, starting with a student up in canada named matty.
and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for.
thank you for making your site.
every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans, sometimes going through language barriers.
this is the last postcard i have to share with you today.
"when people i love leave voicemails on my phone i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again."
they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them, it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother.
have you ever sent yourself a postcard?
have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret?
fw: i have one of my own secrets in every book.
i think in some ways, the reason i started the project, even though i didn't know it at the time, was because i was struggling with my own secrets.
and it was through crowd-sourcing, it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me, that i could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me.
has anyone in your life been able to tell?
and so i think we can roll the video that we have.
if we were outside this, it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
this software allows us to come close and look at parts of this.
and just in closing, i'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so i'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is.
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, i think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe.
trusted not to hurt themselves, and trusted not to hurt others.
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived, and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around.
and sometimes we make real plans.
and sometimes we just start building.
the first idea i'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal.
it means a lot to us.
but music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?
guitar hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the mit media lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.
we are very involved in education.
maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing.
and we do this in many ways.
we work with many different hospitals.
i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on.
it's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
the third idea i want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, i think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are.
i think that's true for many of us, and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.
it takes up the whole stage.
they go off on their own.
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system.
and i'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software.
so we met dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago, when we started working at tewksbury.
dan had never made music before, and it turned out he was really fantastic at it.
and adam and dan have become close collaborators.
what adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have dan be able easily to make his own pieces, but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.
what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music?
so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now?
so he can go in hyperscore.
he can place those exactly where he wants.
we asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
i have the answer to a question that we've all asked.
the question is, why is it that the letter x represents the unknown?
one problem is there are some sounds in arabic that just don't make it through a european voice box without lots of practice.
this is the letter sheen, and it makes the sound we think of as sh -- "sh."
but now we have the answer to our question.
why is it that x is the unknown?
and i thought that was worth sharing.
daniel goldstein: the battle between your present and future self
and these women sing an enchanting song, a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die."
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men -- stay with me -- so that you can't hear the song, and then i'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected."
so this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song.
and no matter what i say, you cannot untie me from the mast.
i want to hear that song.
tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device.
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don't do something regrettable when you have a hot head.
because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it.
he just wants to get to the front row.
he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.
so why do we need commitment devices?
and the future self is not even around.
and so the present self can trounce all over its dreams.
and when you try to execute these commitment devices, you realize the devil is really in the details.
because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.
and i thought, well i could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that.
so then i would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift.
and then i kind of flipped that around and thought, well i could give it to the neo-nazis.
sometimes a good person would find it, sometimes a bad person would find it.
such it is with commitment devices.
so i don't like the way that they take the power away from you.
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them.
and so there's no way that this is going to work."
the present self does not want to save at all.
so what can we do about this?
that is to say, we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old, or we might not be able to imagine that we're going to get old some day.
each outcome is shown by one of these markers, and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement.
being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet.
it means that you have to save more today.
as you move down the ladder of apartments, you see that they get worse and worse.
some of them look like places i lived in as a graduate student.
and we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior.
so this is one of our experiments.
here we see the face of the young subject on the left.
the younger face is getting unhappy.
the older face is quite pleased with the decision.
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun, if they gain weight and so on.
hal is here, so i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image.
i want you to imagine this for a moment.
the most obvious example is suicide.
it might surprise some of you here, as it did me, when i discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world, including the poorest countries of the world.
but perhaps most heartbreaking of all are the stories of the abuse of even the most basic human rights, such as the young woman shown in this image here that are played out every day, sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.
in india, i found the situation was not a lot better.
i had to think out of the box about some other model of care.
the idea is actually quite simple.
and it struck me that if you could train ordinary people to deliver such complex health care interventions, then perhaps they could also do the same with mental health care.
and in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards, spare a thought for that person you thought about who has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about who have mental illness, and dare to care for them.
but what if we had to pay for their true value: would it make us more careful about what we use and what we waste?
but we need to do something about this problem.
but when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?
a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein.
because these are important benefits for the poor.
well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.
so you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.
so now look at the different lens.
so is this just a story from south thailand?
i think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.
and a few friends of mine and i decided this doesn't make sense.
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation.
well i think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.
we are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure."
more of that in a minute.
but the thing is to do a lot more of that.
well what i will say to you in parting is that we may have done that.
i decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman.
i was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence.
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom.
it was always fun to be with him.
he always made me feel smart.
he made me feel he was smart.
he made me feel we were both smart, and the two of us could solve any problem whatever.
but when he didn't win, when he lost, he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won.
i remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him.
they took him -- i think it was for his birthday -- they took him for lunch.
they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena.
he told me this story, and he was really happy and laughing.
and they were full of all kinds of jargon.
and what did we talk about?
well, what do you talk about when you talk about minds?
but the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science-iphizing.
and sidney and i were left there with the two philosophers.
i realized there was something just extraordinary about feynman, even when he did what he did.
i think it may have been a special rapport that he and i had.
we liked each other; we liked the same kind of things.
and dick became convinced at some point that he and i had some kind of similarity of personality.
i think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves.
but he was convinced of this.
and he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection.
and one day we were walking.
and he said, "leonardo, were you closer to your mother or to you father when you were a kid?"
he was a master mechanic, and he taught me how to use tools.
he went off like a light bulb.
in fact, he had been convinced at one time that, to be a good physicist, that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father.
he said that he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary -- the necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist.
he wanted to go out and do an experiment.
he went out and did an experiment.
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father.
and for some time, he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well.
but let me tell you a little bit about feynman the physicist.
style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing.
but no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could.
the thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some.
he did it again in 1968.
this was more or less known.
people were trying to do them.
well, i had some more that i was going to tell you about my connection with feynman, what he was like, but i see i have exactly half a minute.
but how should we honor feynman?
how should we really honor feynman?
i think the answer is we should honor feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can.
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream.
what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell.
he said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream.
welcome to "five dangerous things you should let your children do."
so we build a lot of things.
and i do put power tools into the hands of second-graders.
and we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10.
and what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress.
this is like one of the great things we ever discovered, fire.
these are the three working elements of fire that you have to have to have a good controlled fire.
and you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory.
i have some terrible scars on my legs from where i stabbed myself.
take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school and we'll take it apart with them.
even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them and that means that eventually, they can understand all of them.
so these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them.
and it's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things -- and also when we go out and drive a car.
this happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world that they're trying to get a grip on.
so let me just start with my story.
so my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984.
so we know it can work.
so what about the next step?
and so welcome to super biologics.
these rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years, and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.
this is an example of a real meteorite, and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth, and just how much of it survives and melts.
they would bring them back and mount them.
so this has actually been carried to the moon and back.
but why is this so interesting?
i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures.
instead of showing an object from the stage i’m going to do something special for the first time.
so, i am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.
you’re going to find out why in a minute, because when i went to see eileen, this is what i said i wanted to build.
the room itself is three stories tall.
you can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.
so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects.
so hopefully tomorrow i’ll show one or two more objects from the stage, but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it.
it’s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
but once you’ve seen them in a new way, you realize that both of these things really are connected.
we get to see a skull.
and we never think about the hidden connection.
it's like when i am trying to stand on one foot.
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push.
with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity.
i can also make him spin.
with the same method, we can also get him to circle a person.
you're going to see a lot of imagery, and it's not always connected to what i'm talking about, so i need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other.
so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story.
my current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that i still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on.
and i'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what i do may be connected to why i do it.
this is a piece that i did for the guardian newspaper in the u.k.
but all i have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and i can bring those words out of the background pattern.
and this is for a chapter that i'm doing in a book, and the chapter is on honor.
to say i wonder is to say i question, i ask.
and to experience wonder is to experience awe.
the world is full of wonder.
so i'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force.
but i really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception.
for some reason, i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk.
and this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.
and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person.
i was very busy in the beginning of that year, and i didn't know when i was going to find time to design and print a single valentine.
and i thought that i could kind of do this piecemeal as i was traveling.
i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter, like a found fragment in their mailbox.
i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me, something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was.
and i wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence, end in the middle of a sentence.
so i wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them.
and i'm just going to read one of them to you.
just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile, and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing.
i know this makes you embarrassed.
each one of them is completely different.
i do spend a lot of time on my work.
and one of the things that i've been thinking about recently is what is worth while.
what is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way?
working in the commercial world, this is something that i do have to struggle with at times.
and you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else, because inspiration is cross-pollinating.
and i thank you for allowing me to show it to you.
i was out of the air force in 1956.
light came out of it in every direction.
now, think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.
you turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants.
now, after almost 80 years of having sound, i thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to.
that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car -- small version, over your head -- so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.
maybe if i hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.
the sound is being made right next to your ears.
they tried this back in the '60s and were too smart, and so they gave up.
too many other smart people out there.
i just happened to get my education in a little different way.
they know that when you watch t.v.
they have literally beat a path to our door.
this unit that i played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.
and the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air.
i said we can shorten the column, we can spread it out to cover the couch.
i can put it so that one ear hears one speaker, the other ear hears the other.
turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
i was seeing if you were listening.
so, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on.
it also works five times better underwater.
i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group.
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.
and you can do it the same, over and over again."
so what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?
can you convince them to work with a new toolbox, so that they can build a structure that will be important to me?
what if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like hiv?
and so i give this out to thousands of people.
and so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit.
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.
and so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.
and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels.
and i brought an example with me of that today.
my students promised me it would work.
when you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward.
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- i would hope, at least.
and so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work.
however, if you actually talk to people and even question yourself, and you ask yourself, where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done?
if you ask people the question: where do you really need to go when you need to get something done?
typically you get three different kinds of answers.
one is kind of a place or a location or a room.
another one is a moving object and a third is a time.
when i ask people -- and i've been asking people this question for about 10 years -- i ask them, "where do you go when you really need to get something done?"
you almost never hear someone say the office.
then you have something else to do.
i went to these meetings i was asked to go to.
you cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem.
and even though the workday is typically eight hours, how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office?
when's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office?
and this is why people choose to do work at home, or they might go to the office, but they might go to the office really early in the day, or late at night when no one's around, or they stick around after everyone's left, or they go in on the weekends, or they get work done on the plane, or they get work done in the car or in the train because there are no distractions.
i think that sleep and work are very closely related, and it's not just that you can work while you're sleeping and you can sleep while you're working.
so you have to go back a few phases and start again.
why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office?
that doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me.
it turns out that those aren't the things that are really distracting.
you decide when you want to be distracted by the tv.
you decide when you want to turn something on.
you decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.
some of you may work at places where you can't get to these certain sites.
what the hell is going on here?
no one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago, so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there, or twitter here and there, or youtube here and there?
the real problems are what i like to call the m&ms, the managers and the meetings.
so these are the things that you don't find elsewhere, but you do find at the office.
they don't really do the work, so they have to make sure everyone else is doing the work, which is an interruption.
we all know this to be true, and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees.
all of a sudden you're telling them that they have to stop doing that to do something else.
meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later.
so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting and tends to lead to another meeting.
you can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.
and so we tend to fill these times up when things should really go really quickly.
how about -- pick one thursday once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- i'll make it really easy for you.
and what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done when no one talks to each other.
and you can give someone -- giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work.
giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable.
and there are very, very few things that are that urgent that need to happen, that need to be answered right this second.
and email and other things that someone else can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule.
all these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m.
and i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done.
if you think of everything in your life that you own, when you walk out that door, what do you consider to take with you?
and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.
so why are these things so important in our lives?
and you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience, and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
and you turn around, and you look back into the space, and some people talk aloud.
and a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
let me give you another example of delegation.
this one's a little bit more sophisticated, and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
it has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime.
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone, i call up the local village operator.
and i read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
and ok, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
if you go on the streets of india and china, you see this kind of stuff.
they also write them in hindi.
ok, for me the street just raises so many different questions.
and china is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
and i look at something like this and it makes me question, if we were to take all the functionality in things like this, and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network, how would we prioritize where to put stuff?
and then i go to this picture here, which is the one that i started with.
and we need to learn how to listen.
this is the sound of one hand clapping.
another is to change our lifestyles.
things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now.
what were we just talking about?
and other things that can make it worse, that can cause you to lose brain cells.
your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle, so you age less quickly.
your heart gets more blood flow.
and so these findings i think are really very powerful, giving many people new hope and new choices.
i first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s, but i deliberately waited a really long time.
because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were 17 or 19 or 23 and regretted it by the time they were 30.
which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.
i made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions, of course.
i learned a lesson from it.
it somehow got me to where i am in life right now.
until i tell you who said it.
but if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane, i think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.
regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past.
we need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice, and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.
you're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20.
well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes, it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome.
i should have gone through that yellow light."
we feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly, but almost came out well.
and most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain.
so in other words, we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance.
but for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around, what does that experience feel like?
we all know the short answer.
when i went home that night after getting my tattoo, i basically stayed up all night.
and for the first several hours, there was exactly one thought in my head.
we just want it to vanish.
this real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret.
and the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot.
and for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists -- and i know where of i speak -- this is really hard, because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.
now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos, and i'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.
or you can have your last day at work.
because of course, sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences, either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods, and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.
so how are we supposed to live with this?
i want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret.
and the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality.
we are all in this together.
the second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves.
so it's been several years since i got my own tattoo.
when other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks.
some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are.
i got this tattoo because i spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling.
and when i came and settled in new york afterward, i was worried that i would forget some of the most important lessons that i learned during that time.
specifically the two things i learned about myself that i most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and, simultaneously, how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.
and what i loved about this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image.
it actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us, which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.
here's the thing, if we have goals and dreams, and we want to do our best, and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them, we should feel pain when things go wrong.
the point is to not hate ourselves for having them.
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it fits with what they try to do.
even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.
the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.
half of them gave over the internet.
when i organized my foundation, and i thought about the world as it is and the world that i hope to leave to the next generation, and i tried to be realistic about what i had cared about all my life that i could still have an impact on.
you saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs.
if you bought them in vast bulks, you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.
so the very first week we were working, we got the price down to 500 dollars.
and all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money.
now we can get it for about 100 dollars.
the only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care for people and deliver this medicine.
we tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.
and then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory.
now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.
but the money is there to reach others.
will it provide high quality care?
and two, will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years?
the person, in my view, who has done the best job of this in the health care area, of building a system in a very poor area, is dr.
because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in haiti and a model in rwanda that we could then take all over the country, number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on earth in the last 15 years, and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world.
and so we have set about doing that.
and then we have others working in these other related programs.
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay.
she and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.
and it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.
and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis.
these people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me, helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.
there's a couple of guys from southern farming families -- the first thing i did when i went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it.
thank you and god bless you.
john hardy: my green school dream
i had a really hard time in school.
in fact, my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school.
i have four kids, and even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that i had.
and i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities.
we had had a wonderful life there, and we decided to do something unusual.
we decided to give back locally.
our children spend 181 days going to school in a box.
the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials.
we pay the bill at the end of the month, but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren.
we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible.
the first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing.
they know they can control their world.
and you know what these are.
how many people times how much water.
i met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.
but more than that, people are building green houses around green school, so their kids can walk to school on the paths.
we had to look at everything.
we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.
we feed 400 people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch.
when i see them together, i know that they're working out how to live in the future.
green school is going into its third year with 160 children.
but you also learn other things.
we need someone to come and study it.
and how did we do all this?
it comes out of the ground like a train.
it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this.
green school is a model we built for the world.
and if you're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next 50 around the world, please come and see us.
but he did not lose his voice.
for most of my life, i never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.
i used to be able to talk like that.
i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away.
i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good.
thank god i was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there.
chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long, i might have already been in the car, on the way home, and would have died right there and then.
there was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart.
there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again; it just sort of became obvious.
we need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds.
it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark.
when it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
people don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase.
but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?
how did i feel not being able to speak?
at first i was against it.
i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer.
there was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.
but i decided then to just give it a try.
all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth.
but they were willing to give it a try.
we have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again.
it still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like hal 9000.
it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on "casablanca" and "citizen kane."
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.
he said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice.
now i have spoken my last words, and i don't even remember for sure what they were.
for almost all the years of life on earth, there was no intelligent life.
all of this has happened in my lifetime.
when i bought my first desktop, it was a dec rainbow.
it makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history.
we are born into a box of time and space.
we use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others.
they give me a way to speak.
every time there was a surgery that failed, i was left with a little less flesh and bone.
it is human nature to look at someone like me and assume i have lost some of my marbles.
people talk loudly and slowly to me.
you should never let your wife read something like this.
it is human nature to look away from illness.
my ability to think and write have not been affected.
all of these people are saying, in one way or another, that what you see is not all you get.
so i have not come here to complain.
i have much to make me happy and relieved.
i am writing as well as ever.
i would be trapped inside my head.
i have one more thing to add.
a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer.
and we should save trees in the end.
let me tell you my story.
soon it started to bring results.
but the real hit was in bulgaria.
so first you ask a big question: why we do it?
why am i asking all of these business questions, instead of just showing them pages?
but soon they realized that this is the new role of designer: to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.
so what is the lesson behind it?
the first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.
but the second is even more important.
you can have no budgets, no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level.
and you need to remember that to be good is not enough.
and the students wanted to speak to the government, and police answered with bullets.
and i was very young then.
and i used to run away from home, when i know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of june or so.
so bear with me as i take you through this journey.
when i was 22 years old, i came home from work, put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run.
i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever.
while i was preparing my dog for the run, a man was finishing drinking at a bar, picked up his car keys, got into a car and headed south, or wherever he was.
i was running across the street, and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head.
and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth.
what had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog.
i say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it.
somebody was smart and put a bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that i could get some air in there.
somehow i ended up at the hospital.
18 months later i woke up.
the hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that.
i had more than 50 surgeries.
they needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through.
what in the world are you going to do there?"
the one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom, because they had a long life.
and i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.
but imagine what it was like for them when i showed up at their doorstep?
this kid needs a lot of work."
but one of the first things they needed to do was assess what i needed right away.
i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being, since i'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins.
so i had to go through trying to eat again.
and they went through that process.
and then the next thing that i needed was a makeover.
we're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back.
but i did say no to the blue hair.
so eventually what went on is they decided that, well i need to learn to speak.
so they figured not being able to see is one thing, but they need to get me to talk.
but for me, i was an adult and it was embarrassing, and i had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips, and capture the air and get the word out.
but the men had a better idea.
they were going to make it fun for me.
so i'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when sally finally got my confidence built.
so i moved on from there.
one of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person.
now imagine you have to cross a street.
and the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.
and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me, and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained.
10 years later i gained my sight back.
so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room and i thought it was a monster.
so i was walking around it.
the biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that i'd lost 10 years of my life.
i thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends.
but when i looked down, i realized that time marched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up, so i got going on it.
i need all the courage i can muster to die at the age of 20."
this is how he wrote most of his mathematics.
and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny, he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.
maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.
it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world.
because it is hard to make symmetry.
and he took me up to the temples in nikko.
and just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.
leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."
but if i had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life, being an addict of symmetry, i would probably choose the alhambra in granada.
so, i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra.
but it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.
and it was galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions.
what can you do to a symmetrical object, move it in some way, so it looks the same as before you moved it?
i like to describe it as the magic trick moves.
what can you do to something?
it looks like it did before it started.
what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
and those are things that i can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before i started.
can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it like i did before i started?
but what i could do is just leave it where it is, pick it up, and put it down again.
it seems mad to talk about nothing.
and this is the same idea.
so here is a little question for you.
and i'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer.
how many things can i do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube?
so i want you to think about that problem as we go on, and count how many symmetries there are.
and there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.
if i do one magic trick move followed by another, the combination is a third magic trick move.
so what if i do b, which is a sixth of a turn, followed by c, which is a third of a turn?
what i if i did it in the other order?
it still ends up at half a turn.
but this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.
and you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.
i think this is an amazing development.
and we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the alhambra.
you can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors.
what about the center of a triangle?
a third of a turn where the z pieces meet.
and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.
here is another example in the alhambra.
nothing to do with football, but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.
and it turns out they almost did.
and they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one, it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.
but these are things that we can see.
in order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning.
rather than you all shouting out, i want you to count how many digits there are in that number.
if you all stay down he wins it automatically.
so you should have sat down earlier.
i think there were a few here.
the people who just last sat down.
how many do you have in yours?
so it goes to this lady here.
so now i need to name this object.
leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."
they were making it possible for us to do what they do, and yet, they didn't really understand how they did it.
and this is when it really gets interesting.
and i could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity, at least in the next few hundred years.
the skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
and we are also changing our teeth right now.
there is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time.
but i think from the point of view of a neanderthal, there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have.
so these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand.
so were the followers of hippocrates.
and that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger.
the lesson of the titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries, was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship.
and this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them.
the reason for it, in part, was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable.
so this was the best job he could get.
so many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters.
so this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences.
we need to see what they can do for us.
he had to have some errors.
he had to have some mistakes.
they might have been able to do it earlier.
like i think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.
and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or i can lay them out like a deck of cards.
and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emphasize it and make it more important.
this is heavy so it feels more important.
and i can pull them off when i want to work with them.
and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.
and i can do all that kind of same stuff i showed you before.
there's a lot of work that went into it after that.
the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there.
that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -- the world around us and the world inside us.
but if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky.
what do you do when you grow up?"
because those had been in the news lately.
and so they have to find a way -- and they use algorithms to do this -- to break up that big thing into a million little transactions.
and the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what's actually happening in the market.
all they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said, "stop."
and when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies.
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look, once you learn how to look for them.
you can find it here: this book about flies that you may have been looking at on amazon.
if you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.
and you see this behavior on amazon as surely as you see it on wall street.
so one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies.
these are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means.
these are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to before you get in the elevator.
everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two, and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five.
like the things that people use.
all it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says, "stop."
and how far can you take that?
how far can you take it?
so let me take it back to wall street.
and this is really where the wires come right up into the city.
and the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean.
this is one in my neighborhood.
i mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.
when people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down.
and you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle.
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine, and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved.
and then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in america.
here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in.
we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights -- lights that can allow us to see what we currently don't see.
and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence.
so let me back up a little bit.
however, when we have a real patient on the table, this is the same neck dissection -- not so easy to tell the difference between different structures.
we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society, what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute.
and that may be 20 minutes later per piece.
please go cut that piece out."
so we go back and we do that again, and again.
well you can see this on an mri.
and he brought his whole team with him.
you can see where they are.
but what about the part that goes into the tumor?
this was a bit of a breakthrough.
i think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.
and we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.
we know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.
it requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.
and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today.
think about your day for a second.
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about.
ideally, we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.
now how are we going to do that?
there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen, and that's the ability to get light into the brain.
so how do we do this?
and it senses light with a little eye-spot, which works not unlike how our eye works.
so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons.
and early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004, we gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.
you take this dna and you put it into a neuron.
one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors.
this field has now come to be known as optogenetics.
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear.
so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear.
and there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner, so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.
and the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.
let's give an example of where we think this is going to go.
on the other hand, light can still get into the eye.
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in.
and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.
and so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach.
so how are we going to solve this?
and to point out the power of this: these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.
we're developing these tools, but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world, so people can study and try to treat different disorders.
the second thing that i think i heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors, like an on/off switch.
and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures.
so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another.
and this model may not necessarily be the best for our health.
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside.
i want to take you back basically to my hometown, and to a picture of my hometown of the week that "emergence" came out.
and one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought, when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that i'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i'd just written.
and then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit, and you could sense that the air was not healthy.
and i walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air filter, which was that the streets were completely alive with people.
and it was a beautiful urban day, and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.
all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating -- they were all on display there on those streets.
they don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail.
if you'd gone into the minds of the people, well, you would have seen a lot of trauma, and you would have seen a lot of heartache, and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.
but the system itself of this city was thriving.
so i took heart in seeing that.
so i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well, and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the web is going right now.
same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood?
and the old one looked like this.
this is not the future king of england, although it looks like it.
and these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.
and you can get a list.
that little list there would change.
and i think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.
so the most wonderful thing, i think, about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation.
and so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.
what kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children?
that was a nice thing to get.
so the question is, what is the first question for designers?
so we realized we want full diversity, even though it can be difficult to remember what de gaulle said when asked what it was like to be president of france.
and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?
water has been declared a human right by the united nations.
air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.
now if i was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.
during the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.
the only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by r.j.
the book itself is a polymer.
so instead of just growing destruction, we want to grow the things that we might enjoy, and someday the fda will allow us to make french cheese.
we were left with 38 chemicals.
so we need some help there.
these are how we sold it to ford.
they showed up in five days.
now we do it by molecule.
we lay out the building areas.
and then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.
and this is the concept for the top of the city.
the farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.
how can we begin to understand the way the brain works?
the same way we begin to understand a city: by making a map.
so for example, they can see in the back part of the brain, which is just turning around there.
so if you take a deeper look at the brain, one of the things, if you look at it in cross-section, what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.
and all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through.
and the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input.
we each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
this a place where the dead are brought in.
so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an mr.
and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.
and then what we get is our first mapping.
so this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments.
then we very carefully melt onto the slide.
so again this is what they can see under the microscope.
they understand where to make these assignments.
we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray.
this area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.
so if you want to understand the action of drugs, you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to, and also in the ways you don't want them to.
so now we can look throughout the brain.
we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before, and we see these genes turned on there.
now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity.
and then we find some outliers, some things that lie beyond the cloud.
so i think it's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences, we are quite similar even at the brain level.
this is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were -- and they're quite subtle.
so i'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go.
and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know.
you want to spend it on the poor: how do you go about it?
do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money?
or maybe you turn to the past.
maybe you look at the past and see.
how do you know what would have happened without the aid?
maybe it would have been much worse, or maybe it would have been better.
to give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?
or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen?
so here are some other questions.
and the world has spent a lot of money on it: the gavi and the gates foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it, and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.
how do you use your million to solve this last mile problem?
do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage, or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them?
but how do you do that?
but maybe there is another problem as well.
in the red dots, we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now.
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.
on the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone, then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later.
should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?
the second one is: if i give bed nets for free, are people going to use them?
the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts, it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.
we can know the answer to this question.
we can just run an experiment.
and now we can see what happens.
and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one.
so people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.
maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.
there are so many things you could do.
if we think they should work intuitively, should we go for them?
how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars?
now i'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions.
for your hundred dollars, you get between one and three extra years of education.
so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that, you get 40 extra years of education.
and for every hundred dollars, you get almost 30 extra years of education.
we need that kind of information, we need more of it, and then we need to guide policy.
and i cut it into smaller questions, and i have the answer to these smaller questions.
that doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.
but if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars for every child under five who dies, that would be 90 billion per year just for that problem.
but look what we just did today.
with deworming, you can get an extra year of education for three dollars.
and maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective.
worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.
so we should get started now.
and now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning.
i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference, but can we come back here in 30 years and say, "what we have done, it really prompted a change for the better."
i believe we can and i hope we will.
but i want to turn that upside down for a moment, and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.
i actually want answers from you.
but this is about africa, the story we have not heard.
the stories that we want to know, and the stories that do exist about positive tales.
but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.
so i want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation.
and that has to do with me because in 1994, i packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career.
that was one of my stops.
and the siwa oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.
so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.
now, the thing i remember about siwa was the magical view of the sky at night.
with no natural light source, siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.
and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point.
but what were they there for?
what else is going on there?
so in conclusion, i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.
this time [i'll] give you the entire picture that i saw in 2002, and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in africa, think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.
and think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly.
what should i actually try to replicate?
they had all kinds of things.
and then i'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.
so then i come up to the next thing.
so i showed him these two shots, and then he basically told me what he thought.
and he was looking at me.
and then i did kind of get the reaction i was hoping for.
so i showed him this, and the reaction i got was interesting.
he was hoping it was going to work out okay.
i got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life.
and the very next shot, right after this -- so you can see what i was doing.
and what i was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.
the moment my eye shifted, i immediately started to change them, so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped.
so what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.
what do you think was the reason?"
do you want to take off the other part of it?
have you ever heard of second sight?
so, i want you to just think about it for a moment.
but if i wanted you to look at my right hand, then i look at it, too.
i need two people to help me out real quick.
ok, would you mind just standing over here for a moment?
this will just make it a little bit easier.
i would have told them it was the ace of spades.
come in a little bit closer.
i just touched his back, and i just touched his arm.
you just take a seat over here for a second.
i want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop.
just be aware of the pressure.
allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.
you can wait as long as you want, but only when you want the pressure released.
you can wait as long as you want.
do you want to try it?
just hold on to it for a moment.
but i want you to take this very seriously.
imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass.
i also want you to think of his name.
look at me and think of his name.
ok, think of how many letters in the title of his name.
think about how many letters in the title.
think of one of the letters in the title.
think of one of the letters.
see the way i knew that, because my name starts with a k also, but his name doesn't start with a k, it starts with an m.
i've got one more thing to share with you right now.
kb: i was going to use you for this, but i decided i might want to come back another year.
give them an extra mix up.
give them an extra mix up.
he asked me could he do the left hand.
but if you were to guess.
we need to know why people are doing what they're doing.
would you like to see it?
i did what most of us do -- i tried it on some colleagues.
there must be a reason why."
i think i can do that.
then i had to measure morality.
so poor countries are by and large low trust countries.
let me show you how we do that.
we give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.
and in that pair, one person gets a message saying, "do you want to give up some of your $10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab?"
you only do it one time.
and they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money.
do you want to keep it all, or do you want to send some amount back?
and now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?
make a decision and give me some blood.
one is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.
and i found i could do it with a nasal inhaler.
but why do they do this?
what does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin?
after they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.
now this idea is not new.
so if i do something that hurts you, i feel that pain.
if i do something that makes you happy, i get to share your joy.
but knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off.
what do you think we should do with it?"
we have to find the owner for this."
these are not people you want to have a beer with.
now there are other ways the system can be inhibited.
we don't need god or government telling us what to do.
so i've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives.
and i took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows.
who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?
i also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.
and there are so many ways we can connect to people.
let me show it to you.
what is going to be the future of learning?
i do have a plan, but in order for me to tell you what that plan is, i need to tell you a little story, which kind of sets the stage.
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools, where did it come from?
the empire is gone, so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people, and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it?
what are the kind of jobs that we have today?
those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.
they do need to be able to read.
we know that people will work from wherever they want, whenever they want, in whatever way they want.
and right next to where i used to work, there was a slum.
what did the poor do wrong?
one of your students must have been passing by, showed them how to use the mouse."
on your right is an eight-year-old.
to his left is his student.
then onto other parts of the country, i repeated this over and over again, getting exactly the same results that we were.
but i was curious to know, what else would they do if they could do this much?
sugata mitra: the reason i ended with the face of this young lady over there is because i suspect many of you know her.
we look at it every single day."
how do i get them to pass?
i have to get them 20 more marks.
what i did find was a friend that they had, a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time.
i have no idea what they're doing under that tree all day long.
so she did that for two more months.
when i saw that graph i knew there is a way to level the playing field.
so what are jobs going to be like?
could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?
could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something, you can find out in two minutes?
but look at it this way.
encouragement seems to be the key.
there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat.
i got 200 in the first two weeks.
i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization.
how will we come to know?
there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say, "what are those twinkling lights?"
this one is about what happens to the air we breathe.
this is done by children without the help of any teacher.
my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.
it will be called the school in the cloud.
the way i want to do this is to build a facility where i can study this.
but i want you for another purpose.
and there was this little girl who was following me around.
and i was trying to take a picture of her quietly.
i think it was good advice.
get back into my body now."
you have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.
if i pass out on the next song ...
i think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing, or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements.
i think we will play another tune now.
but here i'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.
however, what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music.
but in a way, you know, it's the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on.
so in the same way that i need time with this instrument, i need time with people in order to interpret them.
there is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about.
how are you going to hear that?"
and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room, and together we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments, and really try to connect with those sounds far, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.
and not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom.
and every single entry had to be listened to, experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not.
i have the sound coming this way.
he would have the sound coming through the resonators.
in the same way that when i see tree moves, then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound.
do you see what i mean?
do you see what i mean?
there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics, dare i say.
but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.
and you know, i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time.
it may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean i have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.
maybe i can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."
not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.
this is how we experience music.
where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book?
and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster.
and so on and so forth.
we had to study from study books.
i need to play a piece of music."
why do i need to learn that?
i need to have the reason, and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."
because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.
but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.
but thank you very much for having me!
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and i scream, "4chan!"
and so what i did is i took it, i translated it into english, and i stuck it up for my friends to use.
this is what it looks like.
there are thousands of memes that come out of the site.
and so there are three that i want to show you specifically.
two is you do not talk about /b/.
it is where a third of all the traffic is going.
and chris just touched on one of those a second ago, and that was the time 100 poll.
and i ended up on top.
i ended up at this really fancy party.
i mean, for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment, there is plenty of bad.
but i think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places, now, where you can go and not have identity, to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like.
but there were some good things that came out of that too.
or is it still up there?
but my parents -- i think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it.
thank you for coming to ted.
i think a lot of it has to do with body size.
you want to measure it by diversity?
you want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size?
and the rest is up to you.
some of them are more experienced.
you transported the bones out yourself to the coast of africa, onto a boat, if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the sahara.
it really is a little bit out of place temporally.
it looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in north america.
when you pick up something like this -- and some of you have had the chance to touch it -- this is a piece of history.
so what we're trying to piece together here is a story.
we had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today.
and then work later is going to take us to tibet.
we really need to take that further.
and the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things, but the paleontologist never found you.
the best way to test this is to actually create a model.
i want to give you three dimensions.
i was failed by my school -- my school failed me.
sometimes i would see bones when there was a body there.
something was going on in the background.
i give you a human face because you're experts at that.
it takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs.
where are all these people going to come from?
those are the questions i ask.
and they gave them two problems.
the next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist.
you have to have those steps.
so we all know what to do in this situation, right?
she catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line.
but then she falls back again.
she loses the check, but she goes home with something bigger and more important.
the fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.
i could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than 4:15.
so it's only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon.
in that very short learning curve, you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record.
so why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer?
64-year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19.
so you have these three mysteries.
you take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice.
what if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group, go out there on that african savannah, pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death?
we could run really far on a hot day.
if you go out by yourself, and you try to chase an antelope, i guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the savannah.
those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack.
you need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent.
it makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it 50 miles away.
they need to be part of the pack.
another thing that has to be true about this pack: this pack cannot be really materialistic.
let him go chase his own antelope."
we try to can it and package it and make it "better" and sell it to people.
why do we keep getting hurt?
humans ran and ran all the time.
all of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day, which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances.
so how do we get back to that again?
and if we find that thing, maybe there is a big fat nobel prize out there.
and what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress, you get rid of the injuries and the ailments.
and what you find is something the tarahumara have known for a very long time, that this can be a whole lot of fun.
and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case.
i almost lost it this week.
and so i want to show you a special moment for me of leo.
he wants to get your cookies.
it turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.
and the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot.
so given that key insight, we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots.
the first was just the screen.
we looked at their desire to cooperate.
and this is what we see when they use just the screen.
and you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.
now let's try to put this into a little bit of context.
but my parents live thousands of miles away, so they just don't get to see each other that often.
so i love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology.
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer, open up a browser and jack into a little robot.
and it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue.
is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?
the quality of advice was identical.
so one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost, but really how long they interacted with the robot.
so the first thing i want to look at is how long, how long did people interact with these systems.
and even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study, they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.
the last thing i want to talk about today is the future of children's media.
but we can push this idea further.
it turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
so changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world.
so here, nathan has changed the letter a to the number 2.
so they are now sending the character back into that world.
but i want to do more than that.
i want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own.
so this is a new project.
but i can tell you, the thing that they love the most is the robot.
what they care about is the robot.
and "how did she die in the back of the car?"
was she in love with him?
was she pregnant when she died?
of course, the queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
i was being asked and paid to do front covers.
i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day, and they were saying there's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill.
but there was a real legal problem because it looks real, but how do you get over that?
and what is going to happen to the monarchy?
so i made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same.
it was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds, but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.
i made it a year ago.
and that situation cannot be right.
we must do something about it.
what are you going to do?
i'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.
look at the situation in mauritius.
that is something to keep in mind.
i have to take care of my own problems.
but that is not my expectation.
we cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them.
this has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.
we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.
let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute, so you get a glimpse of what we do, and i'll talk a little bit more about it.
what we have done is to show that high-quality health care, comparable to the best anywhere in the world, can be done in a developing country environment.
-- and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the united states.
additionally, we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.
and i will tell you how we're able to do it.
very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay, unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.
we made sure that we produced some things ourselves.
we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology.
how do we make it work?
and we have now decided to go into africa.
we hope to open in 2008-09.
and we will do other centers.
it's proprietary to us, and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it.
this is at the heart institute.
when we do it, we will put the cost of care down.
and everyone will get the care they deserve.
it's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive, and they go home and can't do it.
we form people into groups and make them go into challenges.
we encourage them to bring children.
for those that understand cardiology, complete heart block means certain death.
so we are pleased with that.
but we can still do it.
this is how we can do that.
and for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay, it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay.
in the process, i want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.
i spent three months at the heart institute.
i received training at this institution.
who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?
my job is to make sure that every person, no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life.
and anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation, we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it, and how you can do it.
if we do this, we can change the face of health care in africa.
africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to africa.
those who want to come, i welcome you to come along with me.
temple grandin: the world needs all kinds of minds
i think i'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is.
and one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things, you know, that bill gates talked about this morning.
and i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.
ok, this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters, or pick out the little letters, and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.
and one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract.
in my work with cattle, i noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk.
this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility; all they needed to do was move the flag.
and i was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different.
and they just kind of come up, kind of like this.
and they come up one at a time, and then i think, "ok, well maybe we can have it snow, or we can have a thunderstorm," and i can hold it there and turn them into videos.
and i've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant.
that was like just so super cool.
and where i was bad was algebra.
you also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic.
i was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
and i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it, and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.
you could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.
or do i have something wrong with the equipment?"
i take all the little pieces and i put the pieces together like a puzzle.
now, the thing is, the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together.
we've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.
and this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.
when i was in high school i just didn't care at all about studying, until i had mr.
the thing is, you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind, or your mind can be wired to be more social.
in the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.
this is the work of dr.
i was taught that when i was eight years old.
you know, all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i was little.
i really get fed up when they, you know, the teachers, especially when you get away from this part of the country, they don't know what to do with these smart kids.
and we need to be working with these students.
we need to be doing that.
and it can only use so much memory."
it was great to be here.
temple grandin: because who do you think made the first stone spears?
but if there is someone here who has an autistic child, or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them, what advice would you give them?
tg: well the reason why i got really excited when i read about that, it contains knowledge.
and i was really upset about all the books being wrecked, because it was knowledge being destroyed.
could we bring down the lights please?
and i'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.
so, that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there.
we try to avoid blowing ourselves up.
but more importantly, the reason i wanted to show this picture: look where the other people are looking, and look where he is looking.
and that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.
go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."
in our early days we used to work a lot on rockets, but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.
but i said i'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have.
tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.
you look outside: you have all that beauty that you see, all that life that you see around you, and here we have intelligent people like you and i who are having a conversation here.
all that started from that big bang.
why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?
is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?
so we literally are all made out of stardust.
so, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today.
six to nine months at the right time of the year.
and these rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today, so i thought i would show you a little bit what they are doing.
this is one very large crater.
and the reason is, many of you went to the grand canyon, and you see in the wall of the grand canyon, you see these layers.
so if you can read the layers it's like reading your book, and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location.
it turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on mars, as you are seeing here, and when the dust devil comes over the rover, it just cleans it up.
so let me go on the next short video.
we have a picture right now.
so anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet.
so the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it.
lc: after the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed, the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far phoenix really is from the ground.
eb: and then it has to light up its engines, right itself, and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
and edl itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.
so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you, kind of, the steps we go through.
as you saw a little bit earlier, when we were doing the phoenix one, we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.
so we have to study all kinds of different materials, the shape that we want to do.
first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can.
so these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know, that we have to face.
if we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.
so we have to do all kinds of tests.
and then we actually do the actual building and the flight.
that big shield that you see outside, that's a heat shield which is going to protect it.
so we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it.
so we came up with this ingenious idea, which is used here on earth for helicopters.
and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist.
and you see the amount of detail that is in those rings, which are the particles.
what you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on saturn itself.
and we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form, each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this, and telling nasa we need more money so we can explain what these things look like, or why they formed that way.
one of them is called enceladus.
and the reason i showed the little arrow there, i think that should say 30 miles, we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.
so if you were on titan, you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here.
and this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.
you see the rivers which are coming along the coast, and you see that white area which looks like catalina island, and that looks like an ocean.
now why am i telling you this story, and what does this have to do with the future of health?
what do you think you have in a month?
and one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left.
we spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life.
and we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world.
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them.
the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible.
how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick?
you can step on the scale.
and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients.
now if you have trouble maintaining your diet, it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you.
i might want to watch how much dessert i have at the lunch break for example.
it should be on the market within a year or two.
if you think about it, every cell in your body has the same dna as you had when you were an embryo.
my grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap; half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar.
might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet?
dare i admit that after she did it i never really loved her again?
it actually happened right at the time we met.
besides, for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence.
something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured in those days.
i kept finding myself at her page.
it changed our view of the physical world.
and at last, we appear to be doing something about it.
i have one image in my office.
and thank you to all the photographers.
12 people have stood on the moon.
it all started back in 2001.
but i realized on the morning of day one that i had no idea exactly what i'd let myself in for.
we started running very low on food.
we were just over 200 miles left to go to the pole, and we'd run out of time.
we didn't get to the pole, and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the pr, so no one had heard of this expedition.
and i got back to heathrow.
i went back to live with my mum.
so for some reason, this was what i wanted to have a crack at, but i knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece, let alone make it across to canada, i had to take a radical approach.
we were stuck there for 10 days.
and i don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.
later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.
i knew there was more open water.
this was my little bit of bio-mimicry.
it also meant, if the worst came to the worst, i could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me.
another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology.
i finally got through to my mum.
she asked me to call her back.
i wanted to get as close to canada as i could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue.
this was the last day i had on the ice.
there are huge areas of open water just south of your position.
i could measure it with my skis.
he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front, and i climbed in the back.
he put his hand on the throttle.
you can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.
he put his hand on the throttle.
and only from the air did i see the big picture.
two of us are doing it.
i walked with him to his office.
and he explained to me that, when i shave, i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is, but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair, and this creates lack of symmetry.
he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric.
he asked me to go and shave.
let me tell you, this was a strange way to shave, because i thought about it and i realized that the way i was shaving then would be the way i would shave for the rest of my life -- because i had to keep the width the same.
do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently?"
but i decided not to have this treatment.
where was this guilt trip coming from?"
and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already, and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing.
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story.
there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly.
so i looked carefully at this guy.
what would have happened if he was in the other group?
would we have thrown him out then?"
the most difficult thing, of course, is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives.
but this was not the case.
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
no search party was coming to look for these men.
so most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves, but we all know what it's like to be afraid.
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?
but at a certain point, most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.
we learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed, and not every earthquake brings buildings down.
so the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children?
the time had come for the men to make a plan, but they had very few options.
these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men, and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died.
now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.
what if instead of calling them fears, we called them stories?
just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature: what will happen next?
as a writer, i can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events, and fear works in that same way.
when i was writing my first novel, "the age of miracles," i spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the earth suddenly began to slow down.
what would happen to our days?
what would happen to our crops?
what would happen to our minds?
and then it was only later that i realized how very similar these questions were to the ones i used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night.
what will happen to my family?
and the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.
so how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others?
after more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food as they knew they might, and they were still quite far from land.
when the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive, and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other?
the problem was that they listened to the wrong story.
and maybe if we all tried to read our fears, we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them.
read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance, a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.
and i am now going to argue that this is only half true.
we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection.
please let there be some left.'"
so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
and, "do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?"
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
because your choice now is either i use my own needle now, or i could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me 10 years from now, or i could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow.
this is a really easy problem.
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service.
there is nothing on the other side.
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.
so, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids.
the truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
so in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms.
not for nothing do we call it the lazarus effect.
but what i am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need.
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids, and rightly so.
if we look at the data, we can see that the answer to that question is, mmm.
it doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.
why does she do that job?
and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
i do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them for this particular slide, and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour.
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
i was placed at the center of that war because i was covering the war from the northern part of iraq.
and for a moment i was wondering, are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground, a change that does not come through foreign intervention, through the misery of occupation, through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?
and this is why they revolted.
this is why they did not accept.
would you like to see destruction?
would you like to see foreign troops on your land?"
and the people thought for themselves, "maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in, instead of having the second scenario."
that was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.
now i am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived.
we have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams: these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world, who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets.
this is what happened in tunisia.
people who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices, they tried to kill.
they were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
therefore, they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them, bring them back home.
this is what they were telling.
and suddenly that newsroom in doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority.
we are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.
we are going to spread the message.
and then people started to feel that there's something new happening.
and now libya as you see it.
and you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, "how do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"
but this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from.
and this is the moment that is happening right now in the arab world.
be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization."
you are protecting us by showing what is happening at tahrir square."
so we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world.
we have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world.
let us accept the choice of the people.
let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future.
the future should be ruled by people themselves, even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us.
and let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change, and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance.
it is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident.
what should people here at ted, here in the west, do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here?
this is one of her songs.
let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.
give him a big old hand.
i fell in love with that.
i went up to him and said, how can i learn that?
because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.
so i went back that very summer.
i just fell in love with the culture and the people.
you can imagine how excited they were.
so i thought i would just like to show you some of the pictures i've taken of some of my mentors.
and he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.
and you can look at more pictures.
it was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the johnson boys?
we were driving in the car outside of gatesville, texas, where i grew up in the early part of my life.
my mom was driving; my brother and i were in the back seat.
we were really mad at my mom.
you think you can have anything you want.
you think money grows on trees.
you boys make me so mad.
my brother and i stepped out of the car.
we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.
my mom grabbed us by the shoulders.
she marched us out in the field.
and mom was just sitting by the car like this.
he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.
now, my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives.
now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.
the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again.
but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.
and i also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.
and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.
try this old song with me.
my mom was in the audience.
i set that whole thing up.
i set it up with the foreman.
i set it up with the owner of the land.
i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.
i didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."
that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.
and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief, just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.
i had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.
i had to sit down and make lists, because i was ready to go; i was ready to check out of this world.
and i would sit around with it, and i didn't know how to play it, but i would just play stuff as sad as i could play.
this is a song that came out of that.
words no longer say it; let me tell you what i always do.
now, you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes, but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.
but i got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.
and he was working on gyroscopes; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.
and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney.
two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen.
we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.
michael and i were standing way at the side of the kitchen.
so i like to invent things too, and i think i'll close out my set with something i invented a good while back.
and so i put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.
so let me put them all together.
you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.
so i decided to close it down for one year.
also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning, then there is another 40 years that's really reserved for working.
and then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement.
but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large, rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.
i can see my work as a job.
but at the same time, there will be periods when i think is all that really hard work really worth my while?
i am not a religious person myself, but i did look for nature.
looked for something different for the second one.
and then i needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house, and attacked me during my morning walks.
and then just leave it all to them.
and i think by the time this lamp came about, i had finally made peace with those dogs.
i also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali.
so i will not really go too far into it.
i think it took me four years to finally read it, while on sabbatical.
and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.
his latest numbers are fairly impressive.
so i'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.
i've found that finding out about what i'm going to like in the future, my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it.
when i had the idea of doing one, the process was i made the decision and i put it into my daily planner book.
and then i told as many, many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken out later on.
i had thought that i should do this without any plan, that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation.
so i became my own intern.
and i very quickly made a list of the things i was interested in, put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.
and so on and so forth.
this whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies, and not for everybody else.
and i understood that the building itself was a logo.
so then it became quite easy.
on one hand i have nothing against selling.
but i did feel that i spent so much time learning this language, why do i only promote with it?
some of you might have seen it.
and you see the self confidence almost comes back, but not quite.
and then the city of amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.
and the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, "should i really take as much money as i can?
or should i leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
while we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it.
and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters.
we are also working on the start of a bigger project in bali.
and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile.
then you can of course always go and see this guy.
we want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done.
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.
but in any case, what i’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about.
but one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe.
and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution.
and the idea is that everything is defined.
and they were very closely associated.
of who else there is, of the history and so forth.
there’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.
shall i ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations?
i'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old.
we're going to kind of go in a different direction right now.
i hope you all realize that.
they went out and gathered them up.
and that happened for all museums.
so everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.
and this was in the early 1900s.
where are all the little ones?"
but all they had were big dinosaurs.
and so every time they found something that looked a little different, they named it something different.
so you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown and you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary, you would think they were two different animals.
and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like, if it grew in sort of a linear fashion, it would have a crest about half the size of the adult.
now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one.
you go into a museum and they take really good care of them.
they don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside.
so what i want to do is show you these.
and we want to look at these three first.
but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related.
in other words, people looked at them and they saw the differences.
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are.
but if you line them up, if you just take those three skulls and just line them up, they line up like this.
so it is going to get bigger.
if you cut open stygimoloch, it is doing the same thing.
so everyone had a big one.
so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum.
and the little one is really spongy.
now when we name dinosaurs, when we name anything, the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out.
and we get rid of anatotitan.
so we can just keep doing this.
but they had a good question.
it looks like it could still get bigger.
but i didn't have to cut any of them really, because i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14.
so when it comes down to our end cretaceous, we have seven left.
one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that, gradually, as the days go by, all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.
i was planning on finishing on a dance ...
who will start me with $1,000?
15 minutes to change the world.
the problem i have is because gordon brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit.
"although to be honest, when i was at number 11 that was never going to be a problem."
a lot of what i do -- i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them.
but we have a new hope.
how many people here are left-handed?
i happen to believe it was a great error.
i know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states.
but we proved them wrong in iraq.
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago, he said, "if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible ..."
and then it goes to the inauguration.
and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen.
and i was hoping hillary would get to the white house, because she'd have been out of our home for four years.
my wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda."
"i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean.
and these are everyday conventions, conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
and that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.
and we wanted to use the water not only as a context, but as a primary building material.
and so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.
it was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.
moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.
then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.
and then, this is a view going up, and then you could come into the theater, which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.
and here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project.
they asked us to bring an intimacy.
and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.
and this is a guy from salt lake city, this is what they look like out there.
ma: most of the time i spend when i get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.
and so i happened to have a snake pin.
so i wore it when we talked about iraq.
so i went out and i bought a lot of pins that would, in fact, reflect what i thought we were going to do on any given day.
i remember when you were the first woman as secretary of state, and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing, how you looked -- the thing that happens to a lot of women, especially if they're the first in a position.
but people did pay attention to what clothes i had.
go out and look like a diplomat."
so that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.
ma: well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secretary of state a few minutes after i'd been named.
i am sitting behind a sign that says 'the united states,' and if i don't speak today then the voice of the united states will not be heard," and it was the first time that i had that feeling that i had to step out of myself in my normal, reluctant female mode and decide that i had to speak on behalf of our country.
and so that happened more at various times, but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman.
and therefore it means that we have to remember that, while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and pat, you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women.
so i think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women.
i think that they thought that it was a soft issue.
the bottom line that i decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues, because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects, and because, as i said, it is really central to the way that we think about things.
now for instance, some of the wars that took place when i was in office, a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.
but it was one of the first times that i didn't have to cook lunch myself.
so being an american, i decided to set up a caucus.
and so we set it up, and we called ourselves the g7.
so we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal.
but it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women.
i think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room.
and so it was nice when one of them would show up.
and so then tarja was sitting across the table from me.
and my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.
so if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts, they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.
i think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other.
and i think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.
and so i think what needs to happen is we need to help each other.
thank you for joining us today.
have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number?
and if you live on less than $1.25 a day, if you live in that kind of poverty, this is not just data.
we do love a good baseline.
so the pride of lions is the proof of concept.
there are all kinds of benefits to this.
we can't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done.
and the next one is really beautiful.
but you can do something about that.
you can do something about that too.
we're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it.
he got thrown in jail for it, but i have his words tattooed on my brain.
we are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
we are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.
we are going to win because we have dreams, and we're willing to stand up for those dreams."
we're going to win if we work together as one, because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power.
i will say that life involves computation.
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
and if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as i do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.
so one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?
you mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.
this is part of that genome.
the net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle.
the fact is that it does not scale.
it knows when to stop growing because it can count.
it knows how big it is.
the counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing.
if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory.
and you can see how they count.
so, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago, and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things, so i think we made a lot of progress.
so now, what do i want you to take away from this talk?
this is a song that came about because i think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on, and the wars and so forth.
this song kind of came out of all of that.
and i wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which i still stand by, but this has got something else in it.
of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases.
i guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.
you may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks.
often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe.
imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done.
of course you can call the police.
yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in, pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.
all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house, from ground level, making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe.
i do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy.
it never has been and it never will be.
yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.
and he did not want to pay.
so we actually used the right to information act, which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states, and pushed back the officers in this particular case.
and in all these 42 cases, when we kept pushing them back, there was three kinds of reaction.
let me show you what i can do."
and he will push us back.
thank you so much for sharing this idea at ted.
let me begin with an example.
but the one thing i want you to notice about them is this: even though this is a very long list, there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.
the janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise, trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.
and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.
a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule, as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims.
you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.
when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience.
it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
and they were ready to let the kid go.
and the child was sent to a foster home for three days.
but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing: "we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."
how do things like this happen?
how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?
let me just give you a few examples, first of rules and the war on moral skill.
all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city, every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.
but what they assure in its place is mediocrity.
if you have one reason for doing something and i give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it.
sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting, and they make people less likely to do it.
but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens.
the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough.
people have to make a living.
and we certainly see it in the world of business.
it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.
there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.
be proud that you have them.
and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.
he kept every one of them on the payroll.
because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.
because it was the right thing to do.
because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.
in many ways this is the perfect example.
because it took the will to do the right thing.
but most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities.
because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work.
and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.
one is that we are always teaching.
and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.
that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character.
they need to learn to respect themselves.
they need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
they need to learn to respect their teachers.
and i think he was right.
i think there is reason for hope.
i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.
wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons.
this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention.
i could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video: 60 minutes, many of you may have seen it.
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.
they were quite proud of the fact that you know, before the dust clears, if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back, they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the united states.
either way they were going to eat it.
seems like that would be an inconvenience.
most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like first and water and power ....
look what it takes to make things like ipods.
it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."
i went back and i started putting a team together, the best guys i could find with a passion to do this.
i then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really, really useful.
his wife was standing behind me.
imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it, doing either of those.
there is only one opinion that matters, the kids that are either going to use it or not."
they were sitting at a table.
they were brought together for us.
and we started asking them all questions.
and we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them.
we need to know what you need."
he was leaning on his other arm.
he had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.
and he made a few comments.
we said goodbye to all these guys.
and i get a call and we go back to washington.
and he was there, and they said we needed to come.
and i went down and they rolled him into a room.
half of his face is gone, but they said his vision is coming back.
he told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies.
i was asked to stop at texas.
this is not a happy thing.
but universally, these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes, and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them.
who is going to pay for it?"
there are other questions that are tough.
what do we need to do?"
and i'm not going to stop working until we do that."
david blaine: how i held my breath for 17 min
i also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible.
i lived there with nothing but water.
and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue doing more of these things.
the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city.
that one was way more difficult than i had expected.
i began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads.
my next pursuit was i wanted to see how long i could go without breathing, like how long i could survive with nothing, not even air.
by the time i was a teenager i was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds.
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river.
and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by others.
i started to think, if the boy could survive without breathing for that long, there must be a way that i could do it.
and i asked him, how long is it possible to go without breathing, like how long could i go without air?
so, i went to talk to a doctor friend, and i asked him how could i do that?
"i want to hold my breath for a really long time.
this is a little hard to watch.
to actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead.
you know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath.
that's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving.
that was the one that i studied.
and then i learned how to purge.
you blow in and out ...
then i learned that you have to take a huge breath, and just hold and relax and never let any air out, and just hold and relax through all the pain.
every morning, this is for months, i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath for, out of 52 minutes, i would hold my breath for 44 minutes.
then i would breath again for a minute, purging as hard as i can, then immediately after that i would hold again for five and half minutes.
so, everything that i put into my body i considered as medicine.
every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value.
in four months of training i was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes.
i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere.
i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress.
i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and if i stayed there a week not eating, i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism, which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it.
and i thought everything seemed to be on track.
and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions.
and by seven minutes and 30 seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back.
i had failed on every level.
i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.
there was one person there that was definitely not impressed.
my brother had a picture of it.
which was three minutes longer than i had prepared.
i wanted to get them to do a piece on it.
i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do.
so, i had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose, which was a real problem for me.
and it was right next to the sphere.
which was making me more nervous.
and there is no way to slow my heart rate down.
this time it started at 120 beats, and it never went down.
and i was getting more nervous.
it was a waste of o2.
when i made it to the halfway mark, at eight minutes, i was 100 percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this.
there was no way for me to do it.
so, i figured i'm better off just fighting and staying there until i black out, at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.
i kept pushing to 10 minutes.
at 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes.
at minute 12 i started to have ringing in my ears, and i started to feel my arm going numb.
i started feeling pains all over my chest.
and i was sure that i was going to have a heart attack.
so, at 16 minutes what i did is i slid my feet out because i knew that if i did go out, if i did have a heart attack, they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up.
and then suddenly i hear screaming.
and i think that there is some weird thing -- that i had died or something had happened.
and then i realized that i had made it to 16:32.
and i went to 17 minutes and four seconds.
i had the world record and i wanted to make sure it was legitimate.
as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible.
and now we need that magic.
this is a time of need.
walking in front of him was her.
the woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart.
the earth moved for both of them.
and all because he decided to walk that day.
to make it make people want to act.
but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in.
and that is that if we want to have one world, this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion, and then inclusion for some.
i hope the questions will give me an opportunity.
and there are lots of other examples.
they need different ways of being approached, different ways of being enfranchised, different ways of being skilled.
but, particularly, what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work.
i rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12.
when i joined as finance minister, i thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent.
i think we can make it, and the reason we can make it is because of the people.
and that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table.
what she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future, where her children could really have a different life.
i'm going to try to give you a view of the world as i see it, the problems and the opportunities that we face, and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.
let me start off showing you an al gore movie that you may have seen before.
this is a little more inconvenient.
when mahatma gandhi was asked, "how do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one?"
the rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.
what will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 years?
most of them were about resources.
what will that do to bangladesh?
and take a look at this.
this is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.
and then we watched, as one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it marched every year, westwardly.
human beings have always risen to the challenge.
we all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner, that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.
the european 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough, something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.
and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air.
that means that people are beginning the first step, which is acting out of their own self-interest.
and you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and i heard so many last night that i thought i would share a little bit of mine.
and we had to start all over again.
how can that not make you optimistic?
a disease which killed hundreds of thousands in india, and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in india, ended.
how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?
there are many different kinds of mess.
and so today, i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents.
so let me show you a few objects.
if you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it, and when you eat it, the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface.
so what i did actually is to study this problem, and i found something quite surprising.
very few things are very smooth.
we see mountains in the distance.
so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung, but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man and for a little rodent.
i was very much involved in it, but then turned my attention to other phenomena.
well, i was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has, in fact, seen at long last what had been seen for a long time.
the things on the ground are algae.
i could speak of that for a long time.
i read the book that mr.
could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new?
i played with it for a while, and i made it return to the origin.
it took my friends 20 years.
what got you in that strange business?"
it was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.
there are thousands of books on that.
now compare that with real price increments.
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say?
and it went really well 50 years ago.
and you have the little nonsense which is left.
in this picture, five acts of god are as important as everything else.
in other words, it is not acts of god that we should put aside.
now, i get to the final thing, which is the set of which my name is attached.
so i looked, and like the thousands of people that had tried before, i found nothing.
so where did this come from?
today i want to talk about design, but not design as we usually think about it.
in the history of our planet, there have been three great waves of evolution.
then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution, which was we changed the environment in which we evolved.
so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species, as well as our cultures, because of this change.
now we actually have been doing it for a long time.
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them.
i think they said it tasted like chicken.
and they are now using these in certain cultures.
and in the case of the liger, there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.
once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.
be easier to find us at night.
in other words, the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed.
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create.
it gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.
they can make them take off.
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.
this is where we are in this process.
so you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that.
for the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms.
and then the final step of this, once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings, what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then?
we are not only already using these things in animals, some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies.
we are now taking control of our own evolution.
it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future.
he lived in a fairly wealthy home.
so what did he make of all this?
so he had traveled all around.
he had seen people of different colors living in different places.
now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of uv during the year.
now what happened in our history?
why change it if it works?
humans have been on the move for a long time.
and not all these moves were voluntary.
epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin.
how can we begin to understand it?
you just have to look at your skin.
take it out of this room.
this may even be true when it comes to medical treatment.
i think that is too simplistic.
i want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is you're going to drink a cup of tea.
because it makes a lot of sense.
so imagine that there is an imaginary line out here, so everyone here will be group a, everyone out here will be group b.
so you can choose which of the two tea you want.
so imagine that you are taking the tea now, we'll wait for you to finish the tea.
now you're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.
okay, so you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles.
you will spend less time compared to you.
you will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse compared to you.
it all has to do with when you face what i call the inca.
you were responsible for your decision.
i should have chosen the other tea.
so it all ends well, but one thing i didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment, my wife and i decided that we will take the passenger's seat.
and that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that, we could focus on her recovery.
happiness is the freedom of choice.
and who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food.
that was a turning point for my life.
she comes back to the market some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice.
and one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that africa is open for business.
this meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic.
and it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water.
it also has very high cost implications.
in fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that africa's farmers have to bear.
this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
i am here to tell you that change is in the air.
that meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances, and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.
we believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
let me try and explain why.
dry areas cover more than one third of the earth's land surfaces.
this is where the village used to be.
it took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune, which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.
if you happen to live close to the desert border, you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away, and abandon your home and your life as you know it.
if you want to stop a sand dune from moving, what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest.
but, one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood.
if people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees, protect them from humans, and from some of the forces of nature.
we can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us.
i think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice.
some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.
it goes on in nature today, and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.
the world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century.
and i think now is really the time to turn it into stone.
i started a group called open source ecology.
so let me tell you a story.
i found that i would have to build them myself.
and now the project is beginning to grow on its own.
and it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years.
i mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet.
and that was what i did.
the other thing it shows you is that, although there's this beautiful forest of coral, there are no fish in that picture.
we were the best and the brightest.
the waves were 25 to 50 feet high.
and so i'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things.
well, that's what it's like now, but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock.
the trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
we use nets that are 20 miles long.
a book was written about it.
and the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast, because the coast, instead of being paradise, is harmful to your health."
think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage.
the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously.
so what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years?
we say it becomes more strongly stratified.
it's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today.
i would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that.
for how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that i had and will describe to you now?
i was not very good at the other part, so i stayed alone with the cosmos.
i would say they were in their late seventies, and i would say that they were on a date, because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.
and she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean.
i had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.
it was as though time had stopped.
and they turned at once and walked away.
i went with my friend tim mcgonigal, who sat on my left.
on my right was the girl in question.
i was starting high school at the time.
i would say she was a junior, but i had never seen her before.
i did not know what to say.
i did not even turn my head.
i mean, i liked him a lot better than the sandworms.
perhaps it was the crutches, but it seemed -- -- it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.
and so i sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her.
i sure am glad i never saw her again.
and it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
does something seem strange about this to you?
make of that what you will.
and did i want to come with?
i remember what she looked like before she left.
her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country, not even speaking the language, to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen.
it took me some time to come to my senses.
nervous, i went down to the street to look for her.
i did not know where the beach was.
i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes: either catherine would come back to the hotel, or she would never come back to the hotel.
and so i sat down to wait.
and i watched those constellations shift, hoping that they would part and i would see her face.
one of them was named joseph, and he asked me what was i doing, and i explained.
but he did not seem so very sure, for he sat down to wait with me.
she did not understand why i was so worried.
neither did the liberians, although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street, holding hands.
thank you for your kind attention.
and hope actually is at the heart of this.
in fact, the latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity.
and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently.
and i want to ask the question: how far and how fast would be have to move?
how clever would we have to be?
in the world i describe to you, we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon.
so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.
so it looks a little bit like this.
and this, this is where it gets interesting, because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty.
it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis.
is this really how people are?
they want to spend less and save more.
but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view.
that is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives, and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model.
what does all this mean for economics?
what would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche?
so we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term.
it has to be about transition.
what can we offer those people?
it's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty.
so this is not about standing in the way of development.
ca: and if someone could convince you that we actually can make the -- what was it?
so this is what happens as that burn gets going.
let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.
let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water.
if it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
it also makes it very viscous.
and every single oil is different when it hits water.
i have to go buy gas.
that shows you how bad it is.
and we get kind of in on our own con.
but they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing.
and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy.
i think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us.
we actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem.
one of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.
and it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us.
they have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.
but at the same time, chad has become much more unstable, and we are not paying for that price at the pump.
involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump.
if you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids, they might have three jobs or more, and then they have to really commute.
what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?
one thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.
we need to stay away from the moratoriums.
one of the things that we also need to do, is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world, before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.
what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the u.s.
now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount.
we need to kind of rationalize this whole thing, and you can find more about this policy.
let me give you a little sense of how this would work.
and the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign, very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack.
and also, the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system.
but in order to do this, one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon.
people watch it all over the country also in public places.
and in the last season there were two women in the finalists.
but her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it.
last year when i was here, i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole.
and while that swim took place three years ago, i can remember it as if it was yesterday.
i remember standing on the edge of the ice, about to dive into the water, and thinking to myself, i have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening.
and then a thought came across my mind: if things go pear-shaped on this swim, how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean?
and then i said to myself, i've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days.
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following: i'm never, ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again.
this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier.
the glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake.
and so i decided to walk up to mt.
now, i don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt.
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude.
i feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time.
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt.
everest, and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain.
and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier.
everest, and i prepared myself the same way as i've always prepared myself, for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters, and then i realized very, very quickly, i had a huge problem on my hands.
i then began to choke, and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
and luckily, the water was quite shallow, and i was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air.
i carried on for another five or six strokes, and then i had nothing in my body, and i went down to the bottom of the lake.
and i don't where i got it from, but i was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake.
i got myself to the side of the lake.
and my team just gave it to me straight.
every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget.
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.
take some time to rest and think about things.
this is the time to swim with real humility.
and so we walked back up to the mountain two days later.
and i stood there on the edge of the lake, and i looked up at mt.
and i can't begin to tell you how good i felt when i came to the other side.
but i learned two very, very important lessons there on mt.
the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well, doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.
everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long, just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long, doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on.
the warning signs are all there.
and i really should have said something smart.
so, this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.
it is so much stranger than you think.
took me six years at mit, and about that many pages to describe what i was doing, and it took him one page.
we could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way.
and that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.
and you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.
so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope.
one thing i'm really interested about this right now is, how, if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer, how do we make things in a very general sense, and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware?
and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems, share the information and work on those things together.
but they can show you how to build things in sequence.
it was great to hear bill joy.
and so you want that to tow boats very fast.
how can cities help save the future?
and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face.
in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today, we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy.
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place.
and since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place, suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.
and that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.
so you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city.
people are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood.
some of it is about walking.
i asked how to do the greater ridgeway, and it told me to go via guernsey.
and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time, use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
so we light our buildings with daylight.
these things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives.
this is one way to do it.
and certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.
so we have visions like this.
we teach it to our children.
but i'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture.
now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'"
the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded, a hand being chopped off and so on.
the yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.
so the question is, why are so many people so wrong about something so important?
i think there are a number of reasons.
one of them is we have better reporting.
things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age.
now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.
it should force us to ask not just, why is there war?
because we have been doing something right, and it sure would be good to find out what it is.
it would fit both in wright's theory, that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles.
but few people are using them.
but war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc.
and so while i was in the drc, i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including damien.
but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like.
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom.
what is it that you think about just before you get a condom?
but if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it.
and so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.
it might just save their lives.
developing world is a short life in a large family."
and here you have the dataset.
exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.
and really this is about the bedroom.
whether the man and woman decide to have small family, and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world.
they had small families and long life.
and you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.
and you see all the world moves over to a two child family, and a life with 60 to 70 years.
but some countries remain back in this area here.
so we have countries living there.
so the problem i had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born.
look here when i move them forward.
and we will then see a completely different picture.
and when i now finally got it right, i can go back 200 years in history.
and i can let the other countries be shown.
and what has happened in the world, i will show now.
this is instead of studying history for one year at university.
and this is now 100 years ago, where the rest of the world remains behind.
mexico is not at all on par with the united states, but they are quite close.
because after all, talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the united states.
we could actually go to mayflower to eisenhower, and that would be put together into a developing world, which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way, which have great entrepreneurs, but also have the collapsing countries.
this is where you have food to eat.
these people go to bed hungry.
and this is the number of people.
this is $10, whether you have a public or a private health service system.
this is east asia, and the light blue there is south asia.
and this is how the world changed.
and then it will continue forward like this.
we have all this at the same time.
and i can split the others.
we cannot put it into two parts.
and we have countries all this way.
now, this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed.
at this point i decided to make a pause.
but the people doing that at the world bank are among the best in the world.
i would like to show you what happens with the data, what we can show with this data.
and what has happened in the world?
since 1950, during the last 50 years we have had a fall in child mortality.
and it is the dhs that makes it possible to know this.
and how fast has this happened?
and we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.
this means that the world is converging.
it took a little time for them to get independent.
but then they started to grow their economy.
they got a magnificent health system that beat both the u.s.
we never thought it would happen that they would win over sweden!
these yellow are just about to be doing this.
we have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way.
we have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing.
and we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.
but you also see that there are african countries down here.
they have a very high level.
richer country has a little higher.
and this is the situation you see.
we have seen it here in mozambique.
you never heard about the disease.
and we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world.
this is not the state department.
and we have a high hope in you.
this is actually just a picture of the earth at night, and i'm just putting it up because i think it's pretty.
i kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.
we may be hearing more about that today.
it sounds so kind of pollyannaish.
and i think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things.
we all start where we are.
the reason you're trying to understand why they hate us, is to get them to quit hating us.
now, the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter.
this time you can have three words.
the second cost was that we forgot about you people.
we forgot about improving normal lives.
the first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.
it should be interested in the best things in life.
and it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.
it turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.
and how do they differ from the rest of us?
and to ask that question -- happy is not a word i use very much -- we've had to break it down into what i think is askable about happy.
and i believe there are three different -- and i call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.
and this leads to the second life.
and the reason he was, was that len is a cold fish.
and i want to say not.
but what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.
what you get out of that is not smiley-ness.
what you get is more absorption.
and the third path is meaning.
and the answer seems to be yes.
it's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.
and we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.
i want you all to do this with me now, if you would.
the person has to be alive.
i hope all of you have such a person.
but it's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.
and what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set.
and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.
i found the best you could ever do was to get to zero.
every single thing i planned to say, they have said it here, and it looks and sounds like i have nothing else to say.
but there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something, that bud is a young one.
but i want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
we have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countries.
what should we do with it?
we should give food to the hungry.
but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
by holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
does any one of you in the audience have that person?
does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another?
but let me tell you this.
money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
the second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
why should people support their government?
it may have built a road, and that road may have served a very good role.
finally, i want to say that before i came to speak here, i was told that the principle of tedglobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.
in a talk filled with glorious images, he talks about how we all use photos to tell our stories.
but i turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.
i can see the rocks are over here.
we were a little bit rattled.
now i have to tell you, i was talking to kyle last week about this, that i was going to tell this story.
i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me."
i thought i was a hero.
but to be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you.
you've got to be able to make them all the time.
you need to know how to tell a story.
i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail.
for outside the safety of the park were poachers, who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.
and they only came for the ivory.
this is actually one of the rangers.
so instead, what we did was we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put jonas into dharavi, which is part of mumbai, india, and let him stay there, and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city.
and he did it in a beautiful way.
this is called fishing down the food chain.
we also want to look for solutions.
here is in the field hospital.
from here, the more severely wounded are transported back to germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time.
so you can imagine paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water.
here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear.
but then paul got in the water.
and he said he was never really afraid of this.
and paul said he was never really afraid, because she was more curious about him than threatened.
go back and get them, and then bring them back and drop them in front of him.
and she did this over the course of a couple of days, until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head.
and lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.
it is these kinds of stories, ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs, we look at human faces every day.
they are very important to how we communicate with each other.
and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.
i don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this.
and this is very important light to capture, because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.
if you take a look at these scans that we have of emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions.
and you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.
we actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.
and my father was a soldier, and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.
i want to be a doctor to serve them."
that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants.
it has also some beautiful primates.
and i wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.
and the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it.
they were doing whatever they want because they have power.
you can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.
and i was from the same area to him.
all my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.
he has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.
and that was the language of the war.
and what of important things -- i think all of you here have a cell phone.
and what i did for the first war, after we have lost everything, i have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.
and some of equipment went with them, on the top of the canopy, to save it.
and after the war, i have been able to bring it back home, so that we continue our studies.
and there was no way to work.
we have to meet and to talk to them.
so we went to meet them.
we started talking with them and i was negotiating.
i don't know how many people i had on my address.
i sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do.
and i had mine on my pocket.
and when we finished the meeting, i went to return it in the forest.
during the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.
this is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.
they are now happy sending the news that they have protected the okapi with the war, because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere.
what we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war -- we have to rebuild.
see what the wars in rwanda.
i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have.
i think that now i feel nervous.
how many have got opportunity like me to go to u.s., do a master's?
first place i'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.
when you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months, with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.
now i have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous.
we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
so it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range, away from a safe haven.
to experience it is a privilege.
every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.
europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
now we have to get through the ice.
the ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
if we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
the next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.
and the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
the second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
there is a place where you can.
in fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon.
we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
it says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.
we're living in one of the most exciting times in history.
i would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at ted.
it can be done in seven years with the right backing.
those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.
there was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.
that was an essay i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b+.
and some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time i was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.
i thought i would be an artist.
that figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
i have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.
but actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about 14.
and after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.
she did not believe in randomness.
there was a reason for everything.
and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.
and the one my mother asked: how do i make things happen?
and it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
but when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters.
and this happens constantly in the writing.
and if you try too hard, then you will only write the about.
there is also a big question of ambiguity.
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq.
and that means because we went into iraq, we should stay there until things were solved.
and they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
what are we supposed to do?
and all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
and it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said, human rights in burma.
so i decided that i would go to burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if i went there, what the result of that would be, if i wrote a book -- and i just would have to face that later, when the time came.
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.
when i look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and i consider what my intentions should be, i realize it goes back to this identity question that i had when i was a child -- and why am i here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?
in writing a story, it is the place where i begin.
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know.
instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, i actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
these are the things i constantly think about from day to day.
but i do think there's a kind of serendipity, and i do want to know what those elements are, so i can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
and in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?
a big thing that i also think about is accidents.
and as i said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
what is the nature of accidents?
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?
and i saw this beautiful place.
i knew i wanted to come back.
and they agreed, and between the time i saw this place and the next time i went, there was a terrible accident.
when i go on a story, i have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.
it takes a while, but i have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
and i saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
i was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years.
but after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.
so i remained with them, and the more i wrote that story, the more i got into those beliefs, and i think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where i'm gonna find the answers to how i feel about certain questions that i have in life.
the book comes and it goes.
it is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
but i go back to this question of, how do i create something out of nothing?
and i think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
i have to think of my role.
and they have to be in all possibilities, including those i never considered before.
and to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that i am creating.
because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.
i have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.
in a world of too many options and too little time, our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff.
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread, no one wanted it.
and i think that the way you're going to get what you want, or cause the change that you want to change, to happen, is that you've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread.
that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.
and when i talk about it i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation, and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.
but i want you to forgive me when i use these examples because i'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do.
you take the profit from that to buy more ads.
and that model of, and we heard it yesterday, if we could only get onto the homepage of google, if we could only figure out how to get promoted there, if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat, and tell them about what we want to do.
if we do that then everyone would pay attention, and we would win.
this picture is really fuzzy, i apologize; i had a bad cold when i took it.
i buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have.
imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the saturday evening post and time and newsweek.
it came out four days ago -- i circled the important parts so you can see them here.
and in a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.
i could do that again if you want it.
people are paying full price for both, and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common.
the only thing they have in common is that they're different.
the rest of us have to figure out how to think that way.
it was all about going for the center.
i think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you.
but market to these people because they care.
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends.
they only sell them on their website.
those people who buy them on the website have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.
they got this way by being remarkable, sometimes a little too remarkable.
and every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk.
what you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.
the safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes, be remarkable.
and being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do.
for the people who were there and looking at that section, it was remarkable.
because he did something that was at the fringes.
so what you need to do is figure out who does care.
the last example i want to give you.
but they do have a lake.
and people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake.
thank you very much for your attention.
i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine.
this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there.
and it received quite a bit of attention.
so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis, in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years, but also because i read a scientific paper that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.
when i read that, i was blown away by those numbers.
i thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet, but it really wasn't, so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story.
this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp, but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.
you have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end.
so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner, maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.
but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net.
and i hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of 100 million sharks.
and i wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.
here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad.
we have the southern right whale that we see here and the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida.
this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida.
this is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.
and the other problem is they get hit by ships.
so all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low.
i went down there in the winter time.
and these are animals that had never seen humans before, and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.
and i got in the water with them, and i was amazed at how curious they were.
and i really wanted this story to be about three things: i wanted it to be about abundance, about diversity and about resilience.
and one of the first places i worked was a reserve called goat island in leigh of new zealand.
and i wanted to finish with this photograph, a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me.
and i was in a place that had only been protected about 20 years ago.
and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years, and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s.
so i think the message is clear.
i used to be a malthusian.
but i'm moving past malthus, because i think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment.
in the cities, a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.
and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor.
if we can make it through the next 150 years, i think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about malthus.
that evening i came back to the market in the dark and i heard "uhh, uhh," and sure enough i found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.
i'm not going to talk too long about it, but there are so many of the family of uce, which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest, that still have to go through that process.
so i decided that i had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests, to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing, in that way, the loss of habitat and all those victims.
so i created the place samboja lestari, and the idea was, if i can do this on the worst possible place that i can think of where there is really nothing left, no one will have an excuse to say, "yeah, but ..."
everyone should be able to follow this.
this is the place where i started.
there was a huge amount of crime.
people spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.
but we saw the same thing.
but we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.
and then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.
you also know how much labor is needed.
this is how it looks like in practice.
we have this grass we want to get rid of.
the acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses.
so if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
but is it really that easy?
so how to break that cycle?
this is what it looked like for three months.
for three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark.
so these fires are really the first things to work on.
that was why i put it as a single point up there.
but also your legal side needs to be in very good order.
and this forest is quite different.
that means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light, it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.
we could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.
we didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation.
and we do a lot of work here.
and we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.
and in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before.
so this is after one year.
and this is after two years.
we can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.
you measure how the trees grow back, but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.
and finally i made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain.
so you can actually change the climate.
so to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do, because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies.
we have this road going around the area, which brings the people electricity and water from our own area.
each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.
and they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.
if the group doesn't take action, the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.
in summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation, the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.
they also get free land in between the trees, where they can grow their crops.
so if we want to help the orangutans -- what i actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit.
every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility and also a design.
the best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together.
and most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city.
he is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.
very egotistical: he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure.
and every city has its own design.
and it took 25 years until another city ...
and we are very close to my house.
and for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.
and coming back to the car, i always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law: you have to have good relationship with her, but she cannot command your life.
and the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.
you should have always a structure of living and working together.
try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the 24 hours.
and these are the references that we have in any city.
we did it in two months.
some small ones can make the city better.
and we cannot have all the answers.
at the end, i would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.
so i suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it.
and i referenced that at the end of my last talk.
so i want to pick up from there because i only had 18 minutes, frankly.
i believe fundamentally, as many speakers have said during the past few days, that we make very poor use of our talents.
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be, or if they have any to speak of.
actually, i kind of divide the world into two groups now.
i meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.
they get no great pleasure from what they do.
they endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend.
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
and you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often it's not.
every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough.
i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln, who i thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.
i ought to explain that i have no idea what was happening at the time.
and the reason is that you take it for granted.
so let me ask you something you may take for granted.
how many of you here are over the age of 25?
are there any people here under the age of 25?
and so for us, if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it.
they see no reason to do this.
one of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life.
he said i was throwing my life away if that's all i chose to do with it; that i should go to college, i should become a professional person, that i had great potential and i was wasting my talent to do that."
spent the first six months breastfeeding, the way i can see it."
we have built our education systems on the model of fast food.
you know there are two models of quality assurance in catering.
i think we have to recognize a couple of things here.
i worked out recently that i was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that eric clapton got his first guitar.
i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i blew into it.
so i think we have to change metaphors.
we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.
or at home, if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends.
there's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days.
and i wanted to just very quickly ...
how do you deal with a bully without becoming a thug?
has been with me ever since i was a child.
and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s.
but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn't get from training courses.
and they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.
and the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here, inside me.
what will i stand up for?
she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon.
and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her.
but she told the students to sit down.
and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it.
the only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
how can this be made better?
how can the child feel stronger?
i had one of these 3 a.m.
because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.
they are human beings just like us.
they know best what to do.
and they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this.
and i think that the u.s.
military is finally beginning to get this.
so the training of the troops has to change.
and i think there are signs that it is beginning to change.
now that to me is wisdom in action.
have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years?
because finally human beings are getting it.
still it works to help us understand the problem.
thinking it through, i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator.
we have measured our progress very rigorously.
so i can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.
here is the business case for sustainability.
you cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together.
it is a better business model.
but does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?
we can see our way now, clear to the top of that mountain.
and i myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.
on a tuesday morning in march of 1996, i was talking to people, as i did at every opportunity back then, bringing them along and often not knowing whether i was connecting.
and when i read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.
and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me.
knowing you has changed my thinking.
for i never had an inkling that perhaps the things i do might someday, somehow threaten you.
the way the cost of what i squander, what is lost, if ever i forget that you will someday come and live here too."
and we have a choice to make during our brief, brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet: to hurt it or to help it.
these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain.
whatever we do together is pure invention.
and indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine?
and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home.
and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon.
we are so honored to be here at tedwomen, sharing our music with you.
we want to play you one more selection.
and we talk about different ideas -- he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart.
the good news is i'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.
and the good news is i don't have a prepared speech, but i have a box of slides.
i want you to teach me that."
and so for the remaining two years of my high school, i cut all my classes.
and last year i spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life.
i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright, the architect, and i asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in pittsburgh.
my view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on, you have to look like the solution and not the problem.
and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook, so i bought one and put it there.
at a reception in their courtyard, i noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.
and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.
in my view, it is this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor people.
and i got 60 pieces out of it for my school because i felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.
because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech.
and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there."
i said, "well, i got in my car and i went out to the greenhouse and i bought them and i brought them back and i put them there."
you don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.
what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life.
and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program."
i would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.
because i wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place i call my center.
these are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program.
that was done by a student after seven months in the program, done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef.
we even teach people how to read.
the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.
i have 400 kids from the pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education.
and these are children who are flunking out of public school.
i beat out all the ph.d.
let me show you what these people do.
i couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago so i hired a guy who got off on the jesus big time.
and he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.
at the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up and we didn't pick up one parent.
and there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents.
you have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior.
i gave this little slide show at a place called the silicon valley and i did all right.
i only have a couple more slides, and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.
in 1986, i had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while i was building it.
and now that i have, i want to give you a gift."
and i'm going to allow you to record the concert and i'm going to give you the music, and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school."
and i want my music to be with you."
and that worked out all right.
and i recorded it and we won something called a grammy.
including my mother and father, who lived long enough to see their kid build that building.
this was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out in the streets again.
and i love them because they pay the rent on time.
and this is in the process of being built as we speak.
and we got the funding and we open in the fall.
and this is what i want to do when i grow up.
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i'll tell you where i made my big mistake.
thank you very much for that."
the moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams, just in case they do come true.
what do you do for a living?"
and so i kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind.
and now i really want to build one."
what do you do for a living?"
i didn't know ebay from that jar of water sitting on that piano, but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center.
and so i stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken and it was 100 degrees outside, and i started showing these pictures.
and i promised these people that i was going to build this thing, and we're going to build it all right.
and i think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in pittsburgh.
i want you all to know that i think the world is a place that's worth living.
and i'm tired of living like this, going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.
we won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.
and i want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.
i think we can get home on this thing and i think we can build these all over the country for less money than we're spending on prisons.
and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope.
and my hope is that i've made a few here tonight.
and thanks for listening to what i had to say.
so let me start in on that problem.
so what i'm going to tell you about today is a device that we've been working on that i think has the potential to make a difference, to be much more effective, and what i wanted to do is show you how it works.
okay, so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve.
now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output, and what the implications of this are.
the top one is from a normal animal, the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder-transducer device, and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic.
so what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked, what was the retina seeing at that moment?
this is just actually the first one that we tried.
so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna.
they just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life, except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters.
there is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do, but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life.
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life.
i know you think of yourself as human beings, but i think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.
they cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy.
so they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive, and they never get any press for that.
but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well.
the question we had is how could they do anything at all?
and so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals.
and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live.
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room, and this is what we see.
but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.
the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light.
the squid is nocturnal, so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps, but then at night it has to come out to hunt.
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.
this is the word that it talks with.
what i hope you can see is that the molecules are related.
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.
once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.
there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population.
what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you.
what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule.
but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well.
the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria.
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular.
what i would hope that i could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity.
this is exactly what happens in your body.
everything i told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.
i hope when you learn things, like about how the natural world works -- i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child.
i want to thank you for inviting me here.
it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.
so what i would like to do today is have something of a discussion.
the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why.
who should get the best ones?
who should get the best flute?
you can just call it out.
you would do it by lottery.
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.
how many say the best flute players?
why do you think, those of you who voted this way, that the best flutes should go to the best flute players?
we'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
we'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music.
aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy, but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians.
it had to do with golf.
he was a very good golfer, but he had a disability.
how many would say he doesn't?
what about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart?
how would you answer the objection?
who has an answer for charlie?
and what do you suppose they all said?
what do you suppose they said?
but if fairness were the only thing at stake, there would have been an easy and obvious solution.
very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition.
and i think we can do that in public life more generally.
ca: so, i would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.
i'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
now the thing is, i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
and this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
what part of this do people not understand?
so really, this is how i would like to describe it.
but these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.
now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
we will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.
so the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
but of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?
and the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
in other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
this is a very important point for me to get across.
and this is what it is.
we do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
the question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone i talked about earlier for humans?
and thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?
one has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
we need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities.
and this turns out to be useful.
and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
the list on the right is also incomplete.
and there are only seven of them.
first of all, i'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
we do need to really start trying.
so of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
and i think we know how to do it.
i don't know if there's going to be any questions but i thought i would give people the chance.
thank you for asking a question that i can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
if i project that, that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don't crash on my motorbike.
your numbers are a bit out.
the standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.
but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
what i said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification.
it sure used to be a lot easier to be from iceland, because until a couple of years ago, people knew hardly anything about us, and i could basically come out here and say only good things about us.
none of your media got it right.
but i'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly.
and i'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country.
so it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then.
so let me share with you our values.
we care how we make our profit.
it was also about a business opportunity.
the whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men; it is actually about women being different from men, bringing different values and different ways to the table.
you get better decision-making, and you get less herd behavior, and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results.
and some say this was the start of a global movement.
for me it was the start of a long journey, but i decided that day to matter.
so i've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who i am and where i am today.
so i thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here, and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away, and take forward and work on.
we came here saying we want to talk about "africa: the next chapter."
we really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.
now this is a huge achievement.
and in many other countries this is happening.
and instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.
there is no way you can know what people want.
one of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.
like in every other country where this has been done, jobs is the top issue.
i want to leave this up here and come back to it.
but before i get to this slide, i just wanted to run you through this.
and i want to tell you something.
mo ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when africa will be giving aid.
the issue is how are we using what has been given back.
i want to tell you a little story.
and in the middle of that war, i was 14 years old.
we spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
and we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place, but wherever we could help we did.
we were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.
i'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures.
we thought she was going to die.
so i was the oldest person in the house.
she was three years old and i was 15.
and she had such a high fever.
until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was looking at people and giving them meds.
i was scared because i knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
we heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
i walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.
i got there and i saw huge crowds.
almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.
she was doing this in a church.
how was i going to get in?
i had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back, find a way to a window.
and while they were trying to break down the door, i climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
this woman told me it was in the nick of time.
and then my sister woke up.
and about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.
you just want the person to be alive!
and as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.
so if we save people from hiv/aids, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy.
that's why i said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
for which many people, even from other parts of the world, are going there to find jobs.
when we ask them and tell them what we need, one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
we also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience, with private foundations.
and they're also going from country to country, and many times trying to find what to do.
and many of them are not really familiar with the continent.
and many times i get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from africans who might know.
but i worry because this money is so important.
are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money?
will we make the same mistake that we made before?
and we don't do it because there are so many of us.
each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best.
but to help them help us better.
and what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.
ten years from now we will have the same story, and we will be repeating the same things.
but it cannot do it alone.
so there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.
so why don't we think of using some of this aid?
and if we fail to use it as catalytic, we would have failed.
so we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
but i want you to realize that resources in the hands of african women is a powerful tool.
so take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs.
what he and his team found has deep implications for our understanding of creativity of all kinds.
and so i'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how i'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative.
and so it gets down to the brain.
this is a short video of how we did this project.
so what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard?
and so we first measured the number of notes.
were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising?
that was not what was going on.
so he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than i wrote it.
cl: you have to have the right attitude to agree to it.
you can see his legs up there.
the fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings.
so the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing, of looking at my hands through two mirrors, laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand.
so what am i showing you here?
this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication.
go ahead and hit that right sound icon.
whether or not you like the music is irrelevant.
this is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner.
so what do we see in his brain?
and so i want to thank you for your time.
and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject.
the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
and what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain, our center for control and experience.
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle.
so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen, and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that.
the first time, nothing will happen, because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."
tl: but we can see that it actually works, even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time.
so the inside of this thing actually looks like a coke machine.
and there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved.
so what can we do about it?
well, there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria.
people have tried for a long time.
we could spend hours going over this.
one of those ways might be better diagnosis.
so we hope this year to prototype each of these devices.
and if you look through the eye, or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye, in fact, you may be able to do this directly, without drawing any blood at all, or through your nail beds.
because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
you spend a certain amount per bed net.
you then have to introduce the mosquitoes, and you have to model that and how they come and go.
we also try to study our foe.
now, one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt.
this is one of those things you just can't make up.
what can we do to the mosquito?
so what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers?
what if we could do that?
you really want to protect them.
and farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to whole foods because our photons are 100 percent organic.
would you like to see it?
next we can actually light them up with a laser.
so you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.
nm: so it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.
this is one of the first ones we did.
i want to take something rather humble to discuss.
so let me run you through a few ideas.
all of the lights are daylight bulbs.
rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
i had a lot of worms in it.
this takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and i sort of water the garden with it.
i have no idea how it works, but i paid a lot of money for it.
so this is my next project.
so basically, the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway.
but, i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible.
and i hope you all take part.
i worked a lot of late nights.
i worked a lot of weekends, and i found myself never having time for all the projects that i wanted to work on on my own.
i have to take a year off.
i need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas."
so the first of those projects ended up being something i called "one second every day."
so the day -- the first time that i forgot, it really hurt me, because it's something that i really wanted to -- from the moment that i turned 30, i wanted to keep this project going until forever, and having missed that one second, i realized, it just kind of created this thing in my head where i never forgot ever again.
even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day.
on a good day, i'll have maybe three or four seconds that i really want to choose, but i'll just have to narrow it down to one, but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway.
i actually ran out, i spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that i had to take my year off, so i had to, i went to seattle and i spent some time with friends working on a really neat project.
one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family, and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law, her intestine suddenly strangled one day, and we took her to the emergency room, and she was, she was in really bad shape.
we almost lost her a couple of times, and i was there with my brother every day.
it helped me realize something else during this project, is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult.
and i found that it's actually been very, very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.
now one of the things that i do is i don't use any filters, i don't use anything to -- i try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that i saw it with my own eyes.
i started a rule of first person perspective.
the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it.
i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this.
i think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
i could show you this animal.
there are 11 numbers, which i call the 11 holy numbers.
it works the same as a wheel.
and the feet just step over the sand, and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between.
and this is working on the stored winds in the bottles.
so, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach, and one of the big dangers is the sea.
and it must feel the water of the sea.
and this is the water feeler.
as soon as it touches the water, you should hear a sort of sound of running air.
so as soon it has been to the sea, it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here, and it knows always where it is on the beach.
i still have to help them a lot.
you can only do them one at a time.
there were several steps to this.
and some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one.
so there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle.
we didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there.
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them.
so last fall when we published the results of that work in science, we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast.
but it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end, and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
early on, when you're working in a new area of science, you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't, and, even worse, leading others to believe it.
so we won't give the rest of the code, but we will give the three quotations.
so with that, i would like to open it first to the floor for questions.
we actually view it as a baby step in terms of, it's taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level.
because instead of taking weeks to months to make these, dan's team can now make these in less than 24 hours.
i think this latest oil spill in the gulf is a reminder.
you may have heard about the koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins, and i promise i will come back to those virgins.
now i did have an advantage.
and yet the more you add, the more seems to go missing.
it wants to be chanted out loud, to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue.
but all is not lost in translation.
not "you must kill unbelievers in mecca," but you can, you are allowed to, but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba, and only if they attack you first.
only god knows the true meaning.
and that number 72 never appears.
and every year i go there and make a map of my study site.
and every colony has a name, which is a number, which is painted on a rock.
and i go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before, and figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.
and by doing this i know how old they all are.
and because of that, i've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger.
so i want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.
and this shows a recently virgin queen.
so the queen goes down in there.
then they come out as adult ants.
really the question that i think about with these ants is what i call task allocation.
so what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.
and when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.
they bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
and curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
they somehow get into this reserve.
this is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.
here it is about 40 minutes later.
and we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.
and this shows how it works.
and the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.
and it would change as the colony gets larger.
the pattern itself is the message.
and the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.
because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
in fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.
the simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -- and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule, like "i expect to meet another forager every three seconds."
so this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger, will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.
that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero, this internet of devices.
so this is the next step from there to here, and this is getting commercialized today.
so, half as much grain is half as much useful, but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer, and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.
if you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.
but all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.
he was one of the first students to emerge from this program.
once i had all these machines, i was spending too much time teaching students to use them.
but the first day of class looked like this.
they were there because they wanted to make stuff.
just year after year -- and i finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person.
you don't need this for what you can get in wal-mart; you need this for what makes you unique.
you don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.
you need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.
and the way you close it is not it for the masses but it development for the masses.
the first step was just empowerment.
she didn't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew she just had to do it.
this is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time.
it was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.
we have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy.
and let me take you back 100 years to 1912.
that has got to be stopped.
now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both.
now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth, you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid-east and away from us.
i know the response to this.
raise your hand if you think you know.
they just move back to the mid-east and those come back.
so actually most of the 11 we have are tied up in the mid-east.
why are they in the mid-east?
so where do we go from here?
over that period you are going to double your demand.
that has nothing to do with it.
it's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil."
there is no free market for oil.
and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil.
but here you can look at the list.
it will replace or be able to be used for that.
do we have enough natural gas?
look at the bar on the left.
it would be three times what the saudis claim they have.
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas.
but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas, because you have plenty of natural gas.
so i think i've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in america.
if we could do that, i think we would take our first step to an energy plan.
you cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an mcf.
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.
do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon?
tbp: i don't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program.
i can tell you it will be a failure.
i mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times, they went ahead and did it anyway.
but that only blew out 500 million.
and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be.
i got out of school in '51.
i saw my first one in '53.
worth t has been on it for 25 years.
air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel.
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution, are you ready to invest in those technologies, even if they aren't maximized for profits, they might be maximized for the future health of the planet?
and that was a real gift you gave this audience.
and so i think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the internet is a gold rush.
it's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick.
this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other.
but you had the same thing with the gold rush.
people would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
so many people left what they were doing.
and what would happen is -- and the gold rush went on for years.
but they keep hearing about people getting rich, and then in 1850 they still hear that.
and they start to decide they are.
they would take a ship down to panama, across the isthmus, and then take another ship north.
same thing happened on the internet.
and you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.
and they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back.
this is the white pass trail.
in fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going.
this is a commercial that was played on the super bowl in the year 2000.
because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly.
all the streets had to be torn up.
it goes on a long time.
so i thought we could build a super bowl ad for this.
and i thought that really -- i thought that would really work, to give that another shot.
i want to point out one thing.
the next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.
and it would clean your clothes.
and this was a big deal.
it was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
and you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this.
this is what it looks like under my desk.
i took this picture just two days ago.
and one friend of mine was telling me a story: not only did they get there and have to wait, but then the engineers, when they finally did get there, for the third time, they had to call somebody.
and they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there.
every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.
i'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule.
i want to warn you about that.
i think nature gave them a helping hand here.
in the beginning, there was compassion, and i mean not just when human beings first showed up, but actually even before that.
i warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.
and there, the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
so, they do understand that if you want to be treated well, you treat other people well.
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.
we all do that, and you see it all over the world.
so, i hope i've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world.
and you see this all the time in the modern world.
if they get less and less happy, that will be bad for americans.
has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly"?
if you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags, it helps to understand what makes them do it.
she was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married, after she had kids, and even after she got divorced and was a single parent, she continued her medical work.
but like every scientist, she appreciated that to make her mark, what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it.
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data.
did they eat fish and chips?
what time of life had they started school?
because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong, that george could give alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right.
well, first of all, it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves.
that requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.
and it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
and they can't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict.
afraid of the conflict that that would provoke, afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage, and felt that they were bound to lose.
and it means that people like many of us, who have run organizations, and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can, mostly fail to get the best out of them.
if we aren't going to be afraid of conflict, we have to see it as thinking, and then we have to get really good at it.
he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.
but he kept worrying about it, and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved.
and what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation.
it turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts.
but he had been so afraid of conflict, until finally he became more afraid of the silence.
and when he dared to speak, he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.
they think of him as a leader.
but when we dare to break that silence, or when we dare to see, and we create conflict, we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking.
let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.
and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago.
and it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking about, what does deep time do to a building?
and now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.
so here's an image of the long view of the search problem.
and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain, so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest.
and then over to the left is bureau of land management land and some private land.
it would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is.
the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey.
in this case it might well be an image of the clock.
number five of the seven is the payoff.
at the end of it there's something physical, a kind of reward that you take away.
how do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about?
this is not a normal building project.
look at those things up on top there.
there are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.
this is one of the mines.
competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.
they both kept their day jobs.
woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.
and there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on mount washington.
you can see why we sometimes call it long mountain.
the harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."
i think i can get up a ways."
you can see all of creation from up here."
this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them.
we realized that we had to name this thing that alexander discovered.
now, danny and i were up at this same area one day, and danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs, which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it, and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.
do i have to do that?
and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.
you can get another angle on danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.
this is all forest service land.
if you go up on top of those cliffs, that's some of the long now land in those trees.
and if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.
he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.
this is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.
and as it turned out the answer is, yes, that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak, and that might be conjured with.
one is the experience of the mountain.
another is the experience in the mountain.
and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end, you'll see what the valley used to look like.
this is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.
the clock experience should be profound, but from the outside it should be invisible.
and then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in, that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.
and this stone takes a perfect polish.
most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.
sometimes i used to walk more at night.
i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting.
and so i was following this guy.
and i took a picture of his shoes, and we thanked each other and just went on our way.
but i do that all the time.
as a matter of fact, i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.
someone made that mistake already so i can't do it anymore.
it does not come for me from research.
and i saw this really smart critic who i love.
i sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot.
because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time.
how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo?
when i was about 21, an astrologer told me that i was going to meet the man of my dreams, and that his name was going to be eric, right?
i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy thing where i do a cabaret act.
we can do anything you ask.
the name of the show is based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother.
and we were getting serious, so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.
so my mother was a little offended.
they have the greatest life together.
i feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.
and i kind of try not to look back, you know.
i do work with different choreographers.
i think of myself as a ... i don't know what i think of myself as.
and she makes all the deals.
and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program.
some kind of day talk show.
because it's all of these things that i love all kind of in one place.
and so i had this t.v.
i want to stay out of the way.
i don't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous.
but you have to make the decision for yourself.
im: i feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.
i forgot that i said that.
i want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.
how could you show a beat up old dress?
this is what i've been doing because i think it's the most fun thing in the world.
and it just began like in the beginning of february.
and here is the last bit.
let me tell you something interesting.
let me tell you the deal.
in the old days when they used to make butter, you know how you make butter?
so who would think that it was low-fat?
have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decade?
have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around?
we felt they were from the age of yesteryear.
we felt that they were out of date.
and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.
now that never would have been possible before.
they would have felt isolated, until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon.
if i asked you to think of the ideas of al-qaeda, that's something that comes to your mind immediately.
if i ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders, they come to your mind immediately.
so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately.
so that begs the next question.
yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights, we do say that human rights are universal.
is it just about a lack of education?
to get to that stage, we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground.
we need to move one step beyond that now.
because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator.
and the aspiration that we have at the moment -- as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism -- is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.
and my time is up, and thank you for your time.
the end of top-down control of news is changing the nature of politics.
i want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world.
and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression.
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with, and are used to.
if you want to have a conversation in this world, you have it with one other person.
and that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium.
put another way, media is increasingly less just a source of information, and it is increasingly more a site of coordination, because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well.
and so as the quake was happening the news was reported.
now they might have liked to have done that here, rather than seeing these pictures go up online.
even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens, rather than from the xinhua news agency.
but nine of the 10 in those first hours.
but these are people who have been radicalized, because, thanks to the one child policy, they have lost everyone in their next generation.
someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose.
that was enough of citizen media.
and so they began to arrest the protesters.
and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.
and in fact that is happening this week.
send the same message to everybody.
very expensive to do, so there is not a lot of competition.
this is how you reach people.
but you can get used to it after a while, as people do.
i understand where you are coming from.
and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media.
the question we all face now is, "how can we make best use of this media?
even though it means changing the way we've always done it."
we've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind.
and what i'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation, how the will to survive can bring that out in people.
and when it occurred, i was the only doctor on the mountain.
and the sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen, and we should have listened to them.
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit.
this is a view of base camp.
this is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.
this is near the top of the icefall.
you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it.
it's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall.
this is a view taken from camp three.
what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit.
this is on the way up from camp three to camp four, moving in, up through the clouds.
and this is at camp four.
once you get to camp four, you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i'll tell you about.
this looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating.
you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit.
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay, fully dressed, fully equipped, laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.
there was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.
we really had no idea what was going on during that storm.
we were just hunkered down in our tents at camp three.
i gave them radio advice from camp three, and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power.
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them, which is really not much, because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle.
it was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there.
there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.
he called in to say that he was alone now.
but rob was now too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it.
they picked the name for their baby.
this is what i carried up the mountain.
i had more supplies lower down, which i asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.
so he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
i have a family to come back to."
after laying in the snow that long a time, he got up and found his way back to the camp.
i couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up.
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it.
and this is how he's going to turn thought back into action.
this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor.
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this survival epic.
so here i am taking care of beck at 21,000 feet, and i felt what i was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself.
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do.
and we had a memorial service there a few days later.
he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower, he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself.
these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today.
those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet.
the third set of ideas are what i call as "ideas that we argue about" -- those are ideas where we have a fight, an ideological battle about how to do things.
because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having, you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently.
now in india's case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today.
we thought of people as a liability.
today we talk of people as an asset.
we talk of people as human capital.
and i believe this change in the mindset, of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital, has been one of the fundamental changes in the indian mindset.
the second thing in india has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs.
so we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment, and really has changed the way indians think of technology.
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization.
but having said that, then we come to what i call as ideas in progress.
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society, but you are not able to implement those things.
and really there are four things here.
one is the question of education.
but now i believe it's reached a point where it has become very important.
so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented.
those of you who have been to india have seen that.
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement.
the third thing is again cities.
and therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products.
every province had its own market for agriculture.
then we have what i believe are the ideas in conflict.
the ideas that we argue about.
these are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.
this is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
this needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce, you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.
that is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.
but most important i believe are the ideas we need to anticipate.
here india can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.
so there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases.
now why does this matter to you?
why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?
it matters because this is a democracy.
here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.
and that makes a huge difference.
and you must have a clear strategy which is important for india and important for the world.
that is why i think all of you should be equally concerned with it as i am.
there is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.
and this is a rainy election day in a small country -- that can be my country, but could be also your country.
because you know what to do about the protests.
the problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing.
so basically i want to ask: what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy?
it was the human rights moment.
so i do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '68 -- nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.
but after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.
and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it, the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message: "the government does not know better."
so this is what went right.
all this was very much under attack.
and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand.
so as a result of it, you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.
and it's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you.
this is the other side of the things that we like.
because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.
you believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this, it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie, it's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.
but i do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is that transparency is stupid.
and by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.
but is this the idea of a free society?
are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues, are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions, because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?
so i had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister, why he made this decision.
because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that 24 hours after this is going to be on the public space, and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."
so when we talk about transparency, when we talk about openness, i really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong.
he gave me my pick of units.
so what that meant was, when i went down to fort dix, i had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
you can imagine the hailstorm of questions i got.
mm: this little kid is in the middle of a war zone.
one of the things i'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.
we got in a conversation with some other people in the class, and it went on and on.
how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
you know, i can answer questions about my movie, but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.
this film was not about the internet, but it could not have been made without it.
so i wanted to show you a clip, and then i was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.
if we could roll the clip.
everything was cauterized, and it was just like there was a void going through the body.
so, it wasn't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal.
and i think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging.
and when i talk about that polarity i get at so many different q&as, and people are really opinionated.
but we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.
and i've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.
and i knew what he was going to say.
you can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.
do you give money to any of the charities?"
are you a friend to them?
and really do give them a hug.
this is, obviously, that famous view now of the arctic, which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years.
so we all look at what we can do.
and at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.
and it was something called ecorock.
so it was a big idea.
there is the inside of our lab.
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.
so then we went forward and built our production line in china.
the exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.
these are people who worked this project for two to three years.
i'll tell you what i did and why i did it.
you did the best you could with the team that you had."
it is made out of silicon.
and i will give you several examples.
so the first one is in the brain.
but the point is we are right on target.
and you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk.
and this is a quote from john after he wrote it.
and john today is fully independent.
he returned to a normal life routine.
pain is something that can make your life miserable.
and i would like to tell you about pj.
and his wife actually took him.
they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital.
and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens.
and he has been very happy.
so i have good news and bad news.
and it has been shown actually outside of the u.s.
and doing that in the u.s.
but i have a message for the men here.
but i have now a message to the ladies.
and the other thing i would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table [who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.
and with that note, i would like to thank you for listening.
you might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this.
i mean is that the way you think of fashion?
people think this is a magical thing.
if you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?
this is a very different demographic.
and this is a good thing.
he had to come up with new ideas, new things that would be hard to copy.
it forced him to be a little more innovative.
this is not unlike the world of comedy.
if you look at the registry, actually, a lot of the registered things in the e.u.
that is a very difficult question to answer.
is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society?
nowadays, we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold.
it also happens to be a relative of parsley.
i'd been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph, and then i heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that i had to go visit it.
visiting greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north.
it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet.
i think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective.
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it, though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
but that being said, we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet, and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen.
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
what looks like a forest is actually only one tree.
imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system.
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection.
but i put that slide in there because i'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.
and now down to another part of the world.
and the baobabs in particular are a great example of this.
this is what i think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.
so, now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet.
we each want to live a life of purpose, but where to start?
they want to be part of it.
they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.
will i not make enough money?
will i never get married or have children?"
your job is only to be human.
and nothing important happens in life without a cost."
but the real question is, what is the cost of not daring?
what is the cost of not trying?
one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation was named ingrid washinawatok.
and when we would gather as fellows, she would push us to think about how the elders in native american culture make decisions.
and she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future, looking at them from the earth, and they would look at them, holding them as stewards for that future.
ingrid understood that we are connected to each other, not only as human beings, but to every living thing on the planet.
and i met them in the early '90s.
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance, hoping that others were alive and doing the same.
and one woman stood there with this perfect carriage, her hands at her side, and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was.
and these big tears fell down her face, but she never lifted her hands to move them.
and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already, but the next generation.
because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future.
and what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure.
i also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership.
and so in a gathering where we're focused on women, while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them, we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered, unable to provide.
and that, when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job, no education, no possibility, well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun.
and then they created a business plan competition.
then they decided that they would do tedx's.
and i think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link.
and ultimately, we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact, measuring what is most important to us.
and my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it, but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways.
and it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change.
and he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital, but he continued to pay a price.
and every day we have a choice.
i had the great honor of working with the child psychologist dr.
and every day he would watch her, and it looked like she was talking to the people.
at age six, this child was living a life of immersion, and her family paid a price for it.
but she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education.
and he said to me at the end of his year, "jacqueline, it was so humbling, because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture.
but especially when i was talking to the african women, i sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."
and we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone.
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written.
so may each of you live lives of immersion.
but we do not know his face.
i find that hard to believe.
i think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.
so i looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits.
which ones of these could be self-portraits?
well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.
so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.
before we go into these faces, i should explain why i have some right to talk about them.
the young man should be made first.
and as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case.
they are made in the right order.
and if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
the last time you were in the presence of a baby -- this happens to be my granddaughter, mitra.
there is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant.
there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board.
and by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain, it has a person on board.
and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired.
and the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared.
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies.
now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.
i don't have to be paying attention to what i hear.
and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability.
because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context.
billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver, and that result in the embodiment of you.
and there are a lot of things that contribute to that.
now i might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears.
if any -- those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation.
we knew that they were going to be slow cognitively; we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities; and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.
and then the child is stuck with it.
it can also happen in the brain.
there are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.
and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.
and they are going to have poor reading skills.
the point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
it takes about 30 hours on the average.
you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right.
think of the children on the slow side of the class.
we have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side.
that means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution, and i'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities, the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution.
it's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future, just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.
it will be a long time before they really understand it.
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
on that occasion, i found my wife carrying something like this.
i did not ask for a condom.
where can i get one in india?
because i tried to make it intimate.
why i am not getting [any]?
now i am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect.
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
that's why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india.
so i decided i'm going to sell this new machine only for women self help groups.
today i want to talk to you about swimming across the north pole, across the most northern place in the whole world.
and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.
he could tell a story about an event, and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.
and one of the stories he told me so often when i was a young boy was of the first british atomic bomb test.
he had been there and watched it go off.
and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense, that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.
and he said that he could actually see an x-ray of his fingers, because the light was so bright.
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world, and show me just how fragile the world is.
he also told me about the great explorers.
there was something about that place which drew me to it.
and it was so beautiful that i've been back there ever since, for the last seven years.
but i have seen that place change beyond all description, just in that short period of time.
and i wanted the world to know what was happening up there.
and i wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening.
and we need to do something about it right now.
and so i had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task.
but the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen.
i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
i had to taste the salt water in my mouth.
i felt confident that i could actually do this swim.
so myself and the five members of the team, we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the north pole.
i have never in my life felt anything like that moment.
i remember just trying to get out of the water.
i climbed out of the ice.
and i remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock, because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages.
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.
and i was in so much agony.
i immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.
and this dream which i had had ever since i was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window.
and for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you.
the next morning, i woke up and i was in such a state of depression, and all i could think about was sir ranulph fiennes.
a number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the north pole.
and after just three minutes in that water, he was able to get himself out.
and his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to england.
we are going to actually have to take them off."
and ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself.
and all i could think of was, if that happened to ran after three minutes, and i can't feel my hands after five minutes, what on earth is going to happen if i try 20 minutes?
i so believe in you lewis.
and i realize the reason why you're going to do this.
this is such an important swim.
lewis, have the courage to go in there, because we are going to look after you every moment of it."
and i just, i got so much confidence from him saying that, because he knew me so well.
so we carried on sailing and we arrived at the north pole.
and then we walked out onto the ice.
i had never seen black water before.
and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice.
and to think that in 30, 40 years they could become extinct.
this is months and months and months of dreaming to get here, years of training and planning and preparation.
you did it against the current!
there are very, very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the arctic.
and i say to them, i think we need to do three things.
the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks.
the second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time.
we need to believe in ourselves.
now is the time to believe.
but the most important thing we must do is, i think, we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.
a bigger one for you to look at.
but this is it, this is the oil in the world.
and what goes on in the future?
and to tell the next part of the story -- and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.
i picked this up at mit.
and so that is my story.
the oil will never run out.
i'm going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health.
so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about.
and our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it.
we want design to get out for people to see it.
we wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place, and i don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm.
i want to make the world a better place.
those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors, and it just kind of shows up.
it turns out they've got to fish where the fish are.
second, we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project.
our other partner is east meets west.
you've got to shine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover.
how is this a hard problem?
we see other examples of problems like this.
in fact that sounds kind of dumb.
we have to think like existentialists.
how are people actually going to use this?
so from the very beginning we started by talking to manufacturers.
it only fits a single baby.
so the idea here is we say, you want to make it hard to use wrong.
in other words, you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it.
well that's why we have lights above and below the baby in firefly.
we actually got rid of all of that stuff.
so i was thinking about, what i really want to do is change the world.
i have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device.
i actually have to pay attention.
i have to think like an existentialist.
we have to ask ourselves hard questions.
and so i came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview.
and so what i'm going to do is, not so much give you the great hits of that program, as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation, what you try to find out about them, and when people deliver and when they don't and why.
one was that they be american.
and why did i do that?
and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
it's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out.
well, they have other, little bit of advantage, but they also have some disadvantages, but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out.
there are many kinds of interviews.
this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual, and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
and he had never appeared in public since that point.
but then i began to think of other things.
it had nothing to do with their intellect, the quality of their intellect.
some of them were very brilliant, some of them were, you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals, but it was never about that.
and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.
these were people through their 90s.
he was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent, for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two.
the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest.
there's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them.
they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you.
we know the great lines, we know the great moments, we know what we're not going to share, and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.
and let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series.
and i thought, this is going to be a piece of cake, because i always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
we never talk before that because if you talk before, you don't get it on the stage.
she was in a great evening gown.
most people think that i was an actress.
i have to end that one.
that's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine, and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.
the public self, the beauty, the intellect, and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again.
she wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.
and he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.
and i'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.
and i asked him one question.
and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had, because he saw the letters.
and he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house, and i met his wife who was from massachusetts, and he and she had exactly the relationship of thomas jefferson and john adams.
but really the most important question i ever asked, and most of the times when i talk about it, people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty, but i promise you it was the right question.
i had known that she had had a stroke, and that was some 10 years before.
and so she spent almost all of her life in bed, but -- i speak of the life force -- her hair was askew.
and she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side.
and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.
i said, "was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"
and she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face, and how she could no longer count on her beauty, and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company, and in that process, she made a number of decisions.
but she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.
the key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions, so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are, and i commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.
just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family.
i am going to speak about corruption, but i would like to juxtapose two different things.
let me talk about my own experience.
now, why did the world bank not let me do this work?
the reason was that the members of the world bank thought that foreign bribery was okay, including germany.
they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are, but they were not allowed to show their strengths, because the world was eaten up by grand corruption.
and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.
and this is, in my opinion, an example of soft power, because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us.
that's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why min is in the trouble they are in.
because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain.
in germany, we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant, but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
i see my time is ticking.
let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened.
i have a story, a story that i would like to share with you.
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words, a few things about my personal life, because i think there is a connection.
my grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in zambia.
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa.
and i was born in zambia.
even though i left when i was only three years old, i really felt that africa was this big part of my life.
and it really was a place where i learned to walk.
so when we came back to italy, and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories.
and so we were always caught in this stereotype.
and i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives, and have dreams like we all have.
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of nollywood, i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions.
so when i proposed the story, i really had all the support to make this film.
and not only had the support, i found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.
and he had nine days to make it.
we thought this was a good story.
in the meantime, we had to cover nollywood, and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.
i would like to show you six minutes.
and these are six minutes they really prepared for the ted audience.
i believe in the power of audiovisuals.
i mean, there are those films that people are making for quality, but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films.
but we can do something too.
smw: you can now walk the street and see a role model.
but then when i discovered the situation in my country, at that time there was so much corruption.
for a young man to really make it out here, you got to think of some negative things and all that, or some kind of vices.
there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience.
i really think it goes both ways.
and i think this is really the theme of this session.
try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.
so this is what i really think.
i would like you to hear their voices.
and i really hope that there will be many, many collaborations, where we teach each other things.
and i really hope that this will happen.
and we know that there are more.
they can be rented for pennies.
there is no life without stories.
frank gehry as a young rebel
and all i'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff.
i either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems, or i really do solve their problems, because usually they seem to like it.
let me go right into the slides.
can you turn off the light?
i like to be in the dark.
i just show it because i want you to know i'm concerned about context.
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
and we continue to work with this client.
the building on the right at the top is now under construction.
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
they wanted a sense of place.
i tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood, whether they were buildings i liked or not.
the piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket.
and i put a piece of tape around it, as you see there, and realized you could sit on it, and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker.
and then, i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement.
i did this building in japan.
and so i made a drawing with a fish, and i left japan.
the thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant.
this was built in six months.
so, i decided to cut off the head and the tail.
and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker.
i played with it in the evening.
i had nothing to do with it.
the only thing i did was, i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal, because i love sailing.
we made it into a sailing craft.
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link, which nobody will forgive me for.
and then we did a camp together for children with cancer.
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together.
and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle.
it made my building look sick.
it led to the building on the left.
i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture.
and it was all of one material, and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.
and they end up looking like stone.
and so i decided to put him in a depression.
i put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.
mine got a little exuberant, but i used lead copper, which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.
but they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.
this is a small house somewhere.
when you have to do something really cheaply, it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
that big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right.
i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.
this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota.
is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?
and so we finally ended up making it.
and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
i keep trying to make it work.
going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.
and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.
and this would be a hotel.
i feel much more comfortable down here.
this is a piece of property in brentwood.
and following that basic idea of the village, we changed it as we got into it.
and then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room, and one on the other side.
and then you enter into the living room and then so on.
the material is lead copper, like in the building in boston.
but the idea is, the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside.
and you feel like you're in your own kind of village.
kind of a fun thing to do.
and we struggled with the image.
they call it the plan coupe.
and i struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner.
these are the models for it.
i showed you the other model, the one -- this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing -- so i understood the problem.
and these are the kind of study models we did.
you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
and it faces into a park.
and the idea was to make this express the energy of this.
i just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out.
but on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.
this is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.
you have to then try and get that back in some way.
actually, this is the smallest hall in size, and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies.
and so it will be quite a different shape.
i just stuck it on there.
but this is how i do work.
i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away.
and i was asked to do a fish, and so i did a snake.
and this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.
it should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first.
how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?
now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.
and so this is what they do.
you'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it.
this is one such volunteer, and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.
so you could imagine they were very excited about it.
and one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.
and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village , it was 800 kilometers away.
and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.
what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal.
it's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.
and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti.
so now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be.
one of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month.
so we can pass these around.
and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.
they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal, and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own.
so when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.
and now i don't actually mean the world that we live in.
i mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat.
i mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.
if this were afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the internet.
and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address.
but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale.
the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops.
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively.
we need to work with the people in these communities, and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems.
one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.
so you can't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward.
we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward.
the other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as -- you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead.
but i think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.
we have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.
where do we like to kiss people?
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes.
our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them.
turn to the person next to you and look at them -- they look miserable.
what happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.
but over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations, as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly.
i learned a huge amount from henry.
this was something more than that.
i did it with my neurosurgeon.
he had a son called jeremiah.
this is a little bangladeshi girl from the east end of london who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face, which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.
he said you could see criminal faces, judging them just on the photographs that were showed.
we think we can judge people on their expressions.
and so they want to see live witnesses.
this is an image of ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.
this is the bar that he set for us.
this is how i looked before."
we then bent a plate up to it.
we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position.
donors are going to be short on the ground, because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death?
so there are going to be problems with face transplantation.
i can put it in place where it's meant to be.
this is a bit like a julia child recipe.
and the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research.
and that's what i want to talk to you a little bit about today.
the way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
so when i started thinking about these issues and how i was going to change what kids ate, i really started focusing on what we would teach them.
if i had one here and ripped it open, and that pile i would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply, because of the way we consume produce in america.
and that is what the usda allows in our food supply.
we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
i really try and teach it to kids.
it really is just a new idea.
it is about what we feed them.
what goes in is what we are.
we really are what we eat.
well, the cdc has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.
and why can they serve that much?
of course you can do it in berkeley."
we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe.
i get up at 4 a.m.
every day and go cook the food for the kids, because this is what we need to do.
i came up with these calendars that i sent home to every parent.
they also may be growing them.
and we serve them in the cafeterias.
we have to start changing this.
and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation, maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer.
and we have to pull it all together.
you know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school.
it has to be so much a part of them that they really get it.
one of the things i do a lot is public-private partnerships.
i work with private companies who are willing to do r & d with me, who are willing to do distribution for me, who are really willing to work to go into schools.
we really need to change it.
you know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
but we really have to educate.
there was just a big study done, and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.
if we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative, and we started thinking about food as health, then i think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch.
and those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick.
those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.
we can all make a difference.
someone must control all of this."
this is what happens when you take away 20 percent of the cars from the streets.
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges.
the first day they all came back.
but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.
if we can understand this, then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.
each day, people make new decisions, and people change and the world changes around them, and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don't even notice.
behind the headlines, what does the world truly know about this place?
i heard their prayer and ate their bread.
and i ever met more humble people.
and i shared their bread and their prayer.
this is why i went to afghanistan.
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport.
but he gave me a cup of tea.
and i understood that his surprise was my protection.
and in this way i could find noor, the hidden light of afghanistan.
what do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect, about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium?
what do we know about the women 10 years after the war?
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh?
they have been saying that since the 1970s.
i was a freshman in college, and this was when we first landed on the moon.
and it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface -- that's the place where you and i are right now, where we live.
it was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee.
three days of fun and music.
and it talked about how to build your own house, how to grow your own food, all kinds of things.
and he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves.
in fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent of how we actually take care of our bodies.
well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease, the key thing that holds us back is access to information.
now i was an engaged patient long before i ever heard of the term.
and if you look in that red oval, that shadow was not supposed to be there.
this is the advice your doctor gives you: "just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife."
i went in for the cat scan, and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs.
so at that point we knew that it was cancer.
so i went in for an ultrasound.
and there were actually two of these.
one was growing out the front and it had already erupted, and it latched onto the bowel.
i also found my wife online.
so i looked for quality information.
i was slowly losing weight, but for me, that was what the doctor told me to do.
and what i read was that my median survival was 24 weeks.
and by the way, here are four doctors in your part of the united states who offer it and their phone numbers."
my oncologist and i talk a lot these days because i try to keep my talks technically accurate.
and the story of how all that happens is in this book.
who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it.
and when she came down those steps, and it was just her and me for that moment, i was so glad that she didn't have to say to her mother, "i wish dad could have been here."
and this is what we're doing when we make health care better.
she studied health care like me.
this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks.
and that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going.
well that's not what he was supposed to do with it.
how big a deal was this?
the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s.
but what else did you do?
we need to be at least as serious as we were then.
the question is, how is it going to help their development?
and how about the long run?
you go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.
they still go up in the short run.
and the question is whether the short run will persist.
maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.
people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue.
and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.
why on earth are they not there?
and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry.
i grew up in a culture of self-effacement.
so i want to talk to you about two things tonight.
and second, that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world.
and in my little corner of the world, these two things are actually related, and i want to tell you how tonight.
keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
you can see it in their faces.
and when they do all of that for about five years, they get the coveted board certification.
you get your board certificate, and you can go out into practice.
and are we talking about just people here in the u.s.
so we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.
we need to make the world a smaller place.
let me bring it to you locally.
and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.
one of the things that i want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
we have a lot to learn.
here in the united states we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.
maybe we have something to learn as well.
and it has to be bi-directional.
they have to be able to teach us something as well.
i need to have a health care lexicon.
we have to work at it.
we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.
we work with a fourth technology.
more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.
the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much.
this is how you hold the needle.
grab the needle at the tip.
we want it to be bi-directional.
we have a need to learn as well as to teach.
in order to break down our barriers, we have to learn to talk to people, to demand that people work on translation.
we need it for our everyday life, in order to make the world a smaller place.
i went off on my own to become an artist, and i painted for 10 years, when i was offered a fulbright to india.
this fishing village was famous for sculpture.
i liked the fine detail it gave my work, but i wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in.
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city.
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle.
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation.
now it had a sense of place.
my life was not going to be the same.
then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line.
i got a call from a friend in phoenix.
and i realized that this was a world unseen.
so whenever i fill up my gas, i think of that liter, and how much carbon.
and i know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton, but he did the calculations for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.
and that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society.
and together they only form about 15 years of supply.
i'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way i am -- kind of a royal wave.
people have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.
you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.
if he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.
we all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.
you can only do this to yourself.
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.
these are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail.
but i want to leave with you the big question.
but i think this is quite clearly untrue.
we know that it's possible to live in a failed state, where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately.
and we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.
would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye, so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors?
there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths.
because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death.
is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?
as we just heard from michael specter, it has changed over the years.
there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
well think of how we talk about food: i would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat.
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.
well this is one thing you can do about them: you can cover them up.
who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
now, to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.
but the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.
now the irony, from my perspective, is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another.
and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being.
in fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering.
when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other."
